Image showing the partition of the island The Irish Partition refers to the split of Ireland into two parts, one of which is a member state of Great Britain (Northern Ireland) and the other of which is a self-governing state (Southern Ireland, called The Irish Free State, today known as the Republic of Ireland). The Irish Partition took place on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 following years of discussion and fighting for Home Rule in Ireland. Despite plans to keep both parts of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the southern part of the country seceded in 1922 during the Irish War of Independence, and the northern part opted to retain its ties with the United Kingdom. Irish Movement and the Home Rule Crisis National Movement The Acts of Union 1800 abolished the Irish Parliament in Dublin and brought about the unification of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland, which resulted in the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the year 1801. For centuries, Irish people have fought against British control. Before the outbreak of World War I, Irish nationalists, the vast majority of whom were Catholic, protested this authority in a variety of peaceful and violent ways. The goal of Irish nationalists was to free Ireland from British rule. Throughout the early 19th century, several attempts to destabilise Anglo-Irish ties and overthrow the Act of Union were made. Beginning in the 1870s, Irish nationalists led by Isaac Butt advocated for Home Rule in Ireland. The Home Rule movement was the leading political campaign of Irish nationalism, advocating for Ireland’s autonomy within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. On 8 April 1886, Gladstone spoke during a discussion on the Irish Home Rule Bill A bill proposing Home Rule for the British Isles was introduced three times in the House of Commons. The first attempt at enacting a Home Rule bill did not occur until 1886. It was at this time that the Government of Ireland Bill 1886 , commonly known as the First Home Rule Bill, was presented in the House of Commons by the Liberal government headed by Prime Minister William Gladstone and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). Due to opposition from unionists in Britain and Ireland, this effort failed. In February 1893, a Second Home Rule bill was introduced and made it past the House of Commons. After three days of deliberation, the House of Lords voted 410 to 41 against the Second Home Rule Bill and rejected it. After two losses in the House of Lords, the Third Irish Home Rule was an amending bill for the partition of Ireland introduced by Ulster Unionists. It was approved under the Parliament Act, which had reduced the veto of the House of Lords, meaning they could only delay the bill for two years. The bill was given Royal Assent on 18 September 1914 as the Government of Ireland Act 1914. However, due to World War I, which lasted between 1914 and 1918, and the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, this ruling was never put into effect. Home Rule Crisis Most Protestants in Ireland were against Home Rule and instead favoured maintaining their union with the United Kingdom. Politically, those who favoured the union came to be known as Loyalists or Unionists. The Home Rule bill triggered widespread demonstrations by Unionists, who had formed the Irish Unionist Alliance to resist Home Rule. Since Protestant Unionists made up the majority in Ulster, Liberal Unionist leader Joseph Chamberlain advocated a provincial government for the region. Unionists from across Ireland opposed the bill and the intended partition at conventions held in Dublin and Belfast. Unionists contended that Ulster should be excluded from Home Rule entirely or in part if it could not be avoided. More than half a million Unionists signed the Ulster Covenant in September 1912, swearing to resist Home Rule by all means and disobey any Irish government. Following the passage of the Third Home Rule Bill in 1912, Ulster Loyalists led by James Craig and Edward Carson established the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) with the goal of opposing the bill’s implementation through violent means. Irish nationalists responded by founding the Irish Volunteers Force formed by Eoin MacNeill to secure the implementation of Home Rule. In April 1914, the Ulster Volunteers smuggled 25,000 firearms and three million rounds of ammunition into Ulster from Germany. In July of that year, the Irish Volunteers also smuggled weapons from Germany during the Howth gun-running. A civil war appeared inevitable as Irish nationalists created their own armed force in reaction to the UVF, and both sides imported weapons. King George V imposed the Buckingham Palace Conference on Ireland, which brought members of both sides together to talk about potential solutions. Due to the beginning of World War I in August 1914, the meeting failed to resolve the Home Rule Crisis. There was an agreement between Unionist and Nationalist leaders to urge theirFILE: test.txt

Brief History of The Troubles in Northern Ireland

For 30 years, Northern Ireland was scarred by a period of deadly sectarian violence known as “the Troubles.” This explosive era was fraught with car bombings, riots and revenge killings that ran from the late 1960s through the late 1990s. The Troubles were seeded by centuries of conflict between predominantly Catholic Ireland and predominantly Protestant England. Tensions flared into violence in the late 1960s, leaving some 3,600 people dead and more than 30,000 injured.

The origins of the Troubles date back to centuries of warfare in which the predominantly Catholic people of Ireland attempted to break free of British (overwhelmingly Protestant) rule. In 1921, the Irish successfully fought for independence and Ireland was partitioned into two countries: the Irish Free State, which was almost entirely Catholic, and the smaller Northern Ireland, which was mostly Protestant with a Catholic minority.

While Ireland was fully independent, Northern Ireland remained under British rule, and the Catholic communities in cities like Belfast and Derry (legally called Londonderry) complained of discrimination and unfair treatment by the Protestant-controlled government and police forces. In time, two opposing forces coalesced in Northern Ireland largely along sectarian lines: the Catholic “nationalists” versus the Protestant “loyalists.”

One of the deadliest protests occurred on January 30, 1972, Catholic nationalists in Derry organized a march to protest the British internment policy, but the military was called in to shut it down. When protestors didn’t disperse, the troops opened fire with rubber bullets and then live rounds. Thirteen protestors were killed and 17 wounded in a tragedy known as “Bloody Sunday.”

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Northern Ireland suffered dozens of car bombings and sectarian attacks perpetrated by paramilitary groups on both sides like the Provisional IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force. Hundreds of civilians were among the dead.

The Troubles came to an end, at least officially, with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which created a framework for political power-sharing and an end to decades of violence.
