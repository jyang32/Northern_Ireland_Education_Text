This Act partitioned Ireland into two parts: Add 26-county Southern Ireland (which after the 1921 Treaty became the Irish Free State). A six-county Northern Ireland. The first elections for the new Northern Ireland Parliament were held in May 1921 and the Parliament met for the first time the following month.

Indeed in the May 1921 elections unionists won 40 out of the 52 seats available. Northern Ireland’s nationalists – most of whom were Catholics – were less pleased; they wanted to be part of the rest of Ireland and governed by a parliament in Dublin. As a result of this desire, most unionists felt that nationalists could not be trusted. Violence and Discrimination In this atmosphere of distrust the number of sectarian killings rocketed. The government responded by establishing the Ulster Special Constabulary and passing the Special Powers Act (1922), which allowed them to arrest and detain suspects without holding a trial. Other political responses to the seeming threat of nationalism included: The abolition of Proportional Representation for local elections.

This usually resulted in extra votes for the wealthy, who tended to be Protestant, and no votes for the poor, who were mostly but not wholly Catholic.

However, relations with the South (now the Republic of Ireland since 1949) remains tense, particularly as Articles II and III of the South's 1937 Constitution laid claim to the whole of the island.

O’Neill’s Policies (i) Economic A New Premier In March 1963 Lord Brookeborough resigned as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. His replacement was the Minister of Finance, Captain Terence O'Neill. Evidence suggests that the Unionist Party’s MPs wanted Home Affairs minister Brian Faulkner to succeed Brookeborough; however, at the time the party’s leader was decided by a group of senior party members, not by election.

To this end a number of key economic measures were either proposed or introduced during his time as Prime Minister: An investment of £900 million in the economy; Modernisation of the railway system; Co-operation with the Dublin-based Irish Trades Union Congress, whose support was important for economic development; The establishment of an Economic Council under Brian Faulkner; The creation of a Ministry of Development (including transport and local government) in January 1965 to drive economic revival; The establishment of a new city based opponent Lurgan and Portadown, to be called Craigavon; The development of a new university in the market town of Colerain.",990,154,5,152,False

Violence and Division Before long, however, the situation in Northern Ireland deteriorated. Tensions increased in 1966 with the commemorations for the 50th anniversaries of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme, and rioting broke out.

Unfortunately the result was not what O'Neill had wanted: (Page 118) There was a reduction in unionist support and divisions of loyalty among the unionist MPs elected; There was also little or no evidence of the hoped for support from Catholic voters; O'Neill, who had never before had to face a challenger in his own Bannside constituency, only polled 1400 votes more than his opponent, Ian Paisley.",926,150,42,152,False

In many ways it is fair to say that the situation in Northern Ireland was worse after the introduction of internment than it was before. The problems lay with both the intelligence behind the plan and the manner of its implementation. Of the 452 men arrested, not one was a leading member of the Provisional IRA; the intelligence was entirely out of date.

There would also be an executive or government. In addition for the plan to work successfully the British insisted that two other conditions would have to be fulfilled, namely: The sharing of power between Catholics and Protestants.

The Anglo-Irish Agreement (iii): Campaign of Opposition The Unionist Campaign of Opposition Unionist politicians decided that the best way of opposing the Anglo-Irish Agreement was by a campaign of non-cooperation with the British Government. However, they were also keen to demonstrate, by strength of number, the depth (Image - Aerial scene of the crowd at the City Hall, Belfast, 23 November 1985) and breadth of unionist opposition to what they termed the 'Dublin Diktat'. The campaign against the Agreement took a variety of forms: Marches to the headquarters of the new Anglo-Irish Secretariat. On a number of occasions the marches degenerated into violence. A huge protest rally was held at Belfast's City Hall on 23 November 1985, attended by an estimated 100,000 people.",976,154,142,152,False

The aim was to show the strength of unionist opposition through the total number of votes the candidates received. The results of these by-elections, held on 23 January 1986, were extremely interesting. The unionists gained a total of over 420,000 votes but lost one of their seats to the SDLP. Significantly Sinn Fein's share of the nationalist vote fell from nearly 42% to just over 35%. This suggested that one of the key aims of the architects of the Agreement, the destruction of Sinn Fein, might be achievable. A unionist 'Day of Action' was arranged for 3 March 1986.

In addition in November 1986 Ulster Resistance, a paramilitary organisation whose aim was the destruction of the Agreement, was formed.

[1.2 Britain in 1935] We can get an idea of what Britain was like in 1935 by looking at five topics. [[1. The Economy]] The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century made some industries very important to Britain. There were industries like coal-mining, ship-building and iron and steel production. After the First World War (1914 – 1918) countries all over the world found that they had less money to spend trading with each other. So at the beginning of the 20th century Britain found that it was exporting fewer goods. In particular, the ship-building industry was nm: doing well, because fewer ships were needed. Many people were out of work for a long time. In 1932 there were 2. 7 million people unemployed in Britain. In Germany, 5.6 million were unemployed.",983,168,5,135,False

While it is not good to be unemployed at any time, it was particularly hard in the 1930s. People were paid a lot less. A man’s pay packet couldn’t buy as much then as the pay packet of a man doing the same job today. Also, people then couldn’t get so much money of the dole or from other government allowances. Nowadays, there are sometimes two people in a family working. In the 1930s, usually only one person in a family had a job, so if that job was lost, then the family was really poor.

There were some cars, but only the better off people could afford one. An Austin Seven cost £100 and most people earned less than £4 a week. New council houses were built for the poorest people who had been living in slums. [[3. The Mass Media]] Newspapers could now print pictures as well as words and they were very cheap, so everyone could buy one.

But it was not completely independent of Britain because of the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was made in 1921. All members of the Dail and Irish government had to swear to be loyal to the King of England. They also had to accept that Northern Ireland would not be included in the Free State unless the Belfast government agreed. A Boundary Commission was set up to decide exactly where the border would be. Britain also insisted on keeping three ports in the Irish Free State so that it could keep Royal Navy ships there.

So, as soon as the Free State was set up, there was a Civil War between the two sides. This took place between 1922 and 1923. The Free State side won, but this war left many people with very bitter memories. Indeed, some people have not forgotten about it yet. De Valera went on to form the Fianna Fáil party.

(Contemporary German joke, 1939) [[Appeasement]] In the years 1938 and 1839, Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, tried to appease the dictators Hitler and Mussolini. To appease someone means to try to do things that will keep him happy and not annoy him. This way, Britain bought time in which to make its army stronger and get more weapons. [[Anschluss with Austria]] Now that Hitler had Mussolini on his side - after the Rome-Berlin Axis - he felt more confident. Now he began to plan to increase the power of the German Third Reich.

It was surrounded on three sides by German power. Czechoslovakia was set up as a democracy in 1919 and was made up of four groups of people: The Czechs who lived in the west of the country. They did most of the running of the government. A part of Czechoslovakia was called the Sudetenland. Three million Germans lived here and wanted to be part of Germany. Slovaks lived in the west. They wanted their part of the country to be independent. Ruthenians lived in the eastern tip. They wanted to be part of Hungary. Hitler encouraged the Czechs to disagree amongst themselves. He said that the Slovaks and Germans should have independent states to themselves. Chamberlain really didn't want to go to war.,996,174,36,135,False

He met Hitler several times in 1938 to try to get an agreement. On 29th September 1938, there was a conference in Munich where the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Britain met. They agreed that Germany should have the Sudetenland. Chamberlain also got Hitler to sign a piece of paper saying that Germany would never go to war with Britain. [[The fall of Czechoslovakia]] The agreement made in Munich lasted only six months. In March 1939, the German army invaded Czechoslovakia. Hitler was able to capture a lot of weapons and some military secrets as well. Mussolini decided he should keep up with Hitler so in April 1939, he invaded Albania.

So there was hardly any coal in Éire, and most people used turf instead. Railway engines in those days were run by steam and so needed a lot of coal. The only railway company which had enough coal was the Great Northern Railway which ran between Dublin and Belfast. The North had plenty of coal. When a train was coming from Dublin, two engines were put on it. The second engine stopped at Newry and filled up with coal. Then it went back South and ran some trains there!

Instead, sugar was made from sugar beet, which could be grown in Ireland. Although wheat was also grown, farmers couldn't get enough fertilizer, so the crops were not very good. People were allowed only half an ounce (about 1½ grams) of tea and half a pound of sugar a week. Electricity and gas were also rationed. Many factories had to close.

They feared that a parliament in Dublin would come under the influence of the Catholic Church. They were determined that Ireland should not have its own parliament. Both sides built up private armies to ensure that they got their way. By mid-1914 it seemed as if civil war was about to break out between the two sides; however, with the start of the Great far in August 1914, it was agreed to postpone the introduction of Home Rule until the conflict had ended.

This changed, however, when a dispute broke out between the two states over the issue of land annuities. The resulting trade dispute, which lasted from 1932 to 1938, became known as the Economic War. It badly damaged relations between the Free State, Britain and Northern Ireland. Causes From 1870 the British Government had lent large sums of money to Irish tenants to enable them to buy their own land. Each year the farmers had paid back a part of the loan. The payments were known as land annuities. Between 1922 and 1932 (Page 69) the Irish Government collected the money due and passed it on to the British Government. This was increasingly resented by many Irish farmers. Fianna Fáil had promised to cancel these payments if they gained power.

De Valera justified his position by stating that Ireland was in an economic depression and that as Northern Ireland had been allowed to keep their land annuities as a 'free gift', then so too should the Free State. In response Britain imposed import duties of 20% on all goods imported from the Free State. The Irish Government retaliated by placing taxes on goods coming from Britain and Northern Ireland, including coal, which the Irish economy depended on. Response of the Irish Government De Valera called a general election in 1933 over the Economic War. Although this only gave Fianna Fáil an overall majority of one seat in the Dáil, it strengthened de Valera's position and his stance against Britain.

De Valera hoped that by making British goods more expensive, Irish businessmen would be encouraged to set up factories to produce commodities previously imported from Britain. Sean Lemass the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated, 'We believe that Ireland can be made a self-contained unit.' However, by 1935 it was clear that Ireland was suffering more from the effects of the Economic War than Britain and in that year they agreed a Coal-Cattle Pact, which increased trade in these two commodities. Effects of the Economic War The Economic War had three main effects: The Irish economy The Economic War hit the Irish economy hard.

This was despite trying to make Irish farmers less dependent on the British market by encouraging them to move away from cattle and increase production of crops such as wheat and sugar beet. Irish farmers lost millions of pounds because they could find no markets for their goods during a period of worldwide economic despair (Source A). The Economic War also damaged trade with Northern Ireland, which retaliated by cutting imports of goods from the Free State, as Fig 2.2 shows. This led to more smuggling across the border to avoid import duties. (Image – “On the other hand, it’s quite possible his story of taking a wrong tunring could be perfectly true”.

He believed that if the Free State lost the battle over land annuities, it would lose its political freedom and independence (Source B). Britain suffered less economic effects from the War and was willing to move towards ending it from 1935.

De Valera believed that starting afresh would allow him to create an Ireland that was much closer to his idea of a republic. This was to be the culmination of his policy or removing all remaining political links with Britain. The 1937 Constitution The new Constitution, known in Irish as Bunreacht na hÉireann, introduced three important political changes to the structure of the state: The name of the state became Éire or, in English, Ireland; The leader of the government was to be the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) instead of President; A new (largely ceremonial) Head of State would be elected every seven years.

Under the terms of Constitution (Source A) the special position of the Catholic Church was recognised. At the same time ‘freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion’ was granted to all other faiths. Article II claimed political jurisdiction over the whole island. However, it added that until the end of partition Éire’s laws would only apply to the 26 counties. The Constitution made no mention of the Kind, yet Éire remained as a member of the Commonwealth. De Valera believed that keeping this link with Britain might make it easier to end partition. However, with the changes introduced in 1937, Éire became a republic in all but name. De Valera just did not use that word for fear of annoying the British or the unionists. The Constitution was submitted to the vote of the people in the referendum.",931,160,33,129,False

In 1938 Douglas Hyde, a renowned Gaelic scholar, was elected as Éire’s first president. (Image – President Douglas Hyde) (Image – Douglas Hyde on his way to his investiture as President, 1938) Response of the London and Belfast Governments Although the new Constitution had removed nearly all symbolic and effective links between London and Dublin, the British Government treated the changes introduced by the 1937 Constitution as insignificant (Source B).

Threats of War As the threat of another major war steadily increased, Britain faced a major dilemma about how to respond to the growing menace of Nazism and Fascism. Britain had three main options: neutrality, rearmament or appeasement. Neutrality This would mean that in a future military conflict a country would not support or help any of the powers taking part. In the 1930s there were many supporters of peace, pacifism and neutrality in Britain. At the same time, however, Britain had an empire to protect.

Defence chiefs encouraged the politicians to increase defence spending whilst using diplomacy to prevent immediate conflicts. The result was (Page 74) increased spending on rearmament (Table 2.1) and the policy of appeasement.

Many wanted to avoid another war if at all possible; Until 1938-9 many British politicians regarded Hitler as being a reasonable politician. They also wanted to right the wrongs of Versailles in 1919; Britain could not afford to bear the cost of major war in the min-1930s; rearmament was too expensive for a country still weakened economically by World War I and the Great Depression.

The Anglo-Irish Agreements, 1938 Introduction The changing situation in Europe forced Britain to try to improve its relations with Éire. Two issues in particular were damaging relations between the two countries: the Economic War and the Treaty Ports. The Treaty Ports Under the terms of the 1921 Treaty Britain had retained military garrisons at the ports of Berehaven, Cobh and Lough Swilly. The British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, realised the continued strategic value of the ports to Britain’s defence policy. However, he was convinced that returning them to Éire would help end the Economic War and would win Éire’s support during a future war (Source A).",952,152,44,129,False

De Valera believed that Britain’s control of the Treaty Ports undermined Éire's ability to develop her own foreign policy. He also felt that it weakened her claim of independence as stated in the 1937 Constitution. He viewed the return of the Treaty Ports as another step in his policy of gradually dismantling the Treaty. If Britain returned the ports, it would end British interference in Éire's affairs and remove the last British military forces from Éire.

On 25 April 1938, after three months of negotiations, British and Irish delegations signed three separate agreements on Finance, Trade and Defence. The Agreements ended the Economic War and returned the Treaty Ports to Éire. The terms of the agreements Éire shall: Remove all special taxes placed on British goods sold in Ireland; Pay Britain £10 million as a final settlement of all debts owed to Britain. Britain shall: Remove all special taxes placed on Irish goods sold in Britain; Leave the naval bases occupied by British troops under the terms of the 1921 Treaty.

Craigavon was particularly worried, arguing that the Ports' return was bad for the security of all of the British Isles (Source B). Significance of the Agreements Britain might have gained financially from the Agreements, but when World War II broke out many in Britain realised the potential effects of the loss of the Treaty Ports, a loss that was reinforced by de Valera's decision to declare Éire's neutrality.

Developments in Northern Ireland 1938-9 IRA Violence With the return of the Treaty Ports to Éire, Northern Ireland’s strategic importance to Britain increased. However, Northern Ireland was in the minds of British politicians for reasons other than strategy in early 1939. In January 1939 the IRA gave Britain four days to announce their withdrawal from Northern Ireland. When this deadline was ignored they started a bombing campaign in Britain. By August 1939 over 120 bombs had been planted at various targets across the United Kingdom, causing loss of life and damage to property. (Image – The wreckage in Coventry, after the explosion of an IRA time bomb which was placed in a tradesman’s bicycle basket.)

Therefore the British Government introduced emergency measures to deal with the IRA threats. The Dublin Government introduced similar measures at the same time. The Conscription Issue In April 1939 the British government decided to introduce conscription to build up their armed forces for war. However, it was decided that Northern Ireland would be exempt from conscription. The British Government feared that many nationalists would oppose being made to fight for Britain.

Northern nationalists were angered by Craigavon's demands, and the North's Catholic bishops issued a statement opposing his request. The Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Cardinal MacRory, stated that resistance to the introduction of conscription would be morally justified. De Valera also voiced his concerns. However, his intervention only increased unionist fears about the role of Éire and the loyalty of Northern nationalists. (Image – Cardinal Joseph MacRory) In May 1939 Chamberlain invited Craigavon to London to discuss the conscription issue.

In the short term this solved the problem; however, it would re-emerge during the war (Source A). Defence Production As some form of compensation for the refusal to extend conscription, Northern Ireland was awarded a number of large defence contracts. In total over £6 million worth of contracts went to a range of industries. At the forefront of the orders were the new Short and Harland aircraft factory and the Harland and Wolff shipyard.

Declaration of War: Response of Northern Ireland Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. The legacy of partition meant that the six counties were also at war with Germany. This would affect all its citizens whether they supported the war or not. With Eire declaring neutrality, the war gave Northern Ireland its chance to show its allegiance to Britain.

Summary of Key Issue One Differences over the issue of self-government led to the establishment of two states and parliaments in Ireland between 1921 and 1922. The years 1922-32 saw both new states establishing themselves and focusing on different priorities. In the case of Northern Ireland the aim was to maintain a viable state free from the influence of the Irish Free State and the nationalist minority within Northern Ireland.,920,148,56,129,False

In the south the priority was the achievement of increasing independence from Britain. De Valera continued and accelerated the drive for independence to the point that by 1937 the Irish Free State (now Eire) was a republic in all but name.

The RAF, Radar and Reorganisation In 1939 there was only one squadron of Coastal Command Ansons based in Northern Ireland. Moreover these aircraft were elderly and out of date. As no one expected Northern Ireland to be at risk of attack from the air, there was no protection from RAF fighters, no searchlights and virtually no anti-aircraft guns. In April 1939 a government committee recommended sending a fighter squadron to Ulster and building two Radar stations in the province. By 1941 most of the province was covered by a radar network. However, some in the RAF warned that enemy planes could still approach Northern Ireland without being picked up. By the spring of 1941 more air-craft guns had been sent to the province.

In July 1940 the transfer of modern Hurricane fighters to the province boosted the RAF. Unfortunately, however, these planes could only be deployed fully in daylight conditions. After the fall of France in June 1940, the importance of the RAF and the defence of the province increased, particularly the role of the RAF Coastal Command in the battle of the Atlantic.

Strategic importance of Northern Ireland With Éire declaring neutrality, Northern Ireland's strategic importance increased greatly. During the Battle of the Atlantic, German U-boats attacked and sank British merchant ships carrying vital war supplies from the USA. Britain needed to protect these Atlantic supply routes with convoy escorts. The nearest suitable port was Derry/Londonderry.

The Lisnahally naval base became very important, particularly after America's entry into the war in 1941. At its height there were over 150 naval vessels and over 40,000 servicemen based there. The North-West also had two major air bases at Ballykelly and Eglinton. These played an important role in helping defend the supply routes across the Atlantic. RAF Coastal Command also opened a major base at Castle Archdale near Enniskillen in February 1941.

De Valera was confident that most people in Éire would support his policy of neutrality. However, he realised that neutrality would not be easy, as it did not guarantee Éire’s security. This was particularly true because of Ireland’s strong economic links with Britain. It was British merchant ships that supplied Éire with coal and other essential raw materials.

In July 1945 the first British General Election for ten years was held. To the surprise of many people, the Labour Party led by Clement Attlee defeated the Conservative Party, led by Churchill. The Labour Party had won because people were attracted by their promises of full employment, nationalisation of industry and the creation of a welfare state (Source A).",950,159,102,129,False

(Image – The Daily Mirror reveals the part of a Welfare State. The New Labour Government The new government faced many problems: Britain had almost been bankrupted by the war and most manufactured goods had to be exported to pay for imported food. There were acute shortages of coal in 1947, while bread and potatoes had to be rationed for the first time in 1946. There was widespread poverty among most working-class people. This period when shortages were more severe than during the war was known as the age of austerity. The Labour Government promised to tackle these problems through improved housing, better working conditions and a welfare state.

In 1947 the coalmines and electricity were taken over by the state, followed in 1948 by the railways. Finally the iron and steel industries were nationalised in 1949. (Page 96) Housing When the poverty of the slums had been exposed by the war Labour had promised a massive house-building programme to provide every British family with a good standard of housing.

Some people opposed the plan to create the National Health Service (NHS) because of the costs required to run it, while doctors resisted the plans because they feared the loss of their independence and private income.

Housing and Education Reforms Northern Ireland had a housing shortage before 1939, but the war had worsened the problem. A report in 1944 stated that 37% of homes in Belfast were unfit and recommended that the province needed over 100,000 new homes. A Housing Trust was set up in 1945 and started to build these homes.

Developing Language for Learning: Changing Relations: Northern Ireland and its Neighbours, 1920–49
It is widely recognised that History is a highly literate subject where reading and writing, as well as historical analysis and interpretation of evidence, is required. It is for this reason that some students, in spite of their passion for studying history, become demotivated due to difficulties they may have in accessing the subject. To aid learning we have produced lists of suggested key words, individuals and terms associated with Changing Relations: Northern Ireland and its Neighbours, 1920–49. The key words produced are not intended to be exhaustive but are simply offered as a starting point for teachers to help their students develop the language for learning associated with this option.

This 'Home Rule Movement' can be linked to the eventual partition of Ireland and the origin of Irish nationalism. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 partitioned Ireland into two new countries. Throughout the 1930s both countries developed their sense of national identity in two very different directions. The Irish Free State saw itself as a largely agricultural and Roman Catholic nation.

Many factors were responsible for this: Despite the neutrality of the Irish Free State during the Second World War, relations with Great Britain improved. German pilots who crash landed in Ireland were kept there as prisoners until the end of the war and RAF pilots were quickly sent back to England.

The welfare state is the system whereby the government provides free healthcare and education. Council housing and income support were provided for those in most need, paid for through taxes. Unemployment benefit, maternity leave and pension benefits were increased and the creation of the National Health Service slashed the country's death rate from the highest to the lowest in the United Kingdom.

Relations between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland also improved during this period. The two countries co-operated in a joint campaign against the terrorist attacks of the IRA between 1956 and 1962.

Nevertheless, this brought accusations that Northern Ireland was a one party state and undemocratic.

Marching is a Protestant tradition dating back to 1795 which commemorates the triumph of Protestant William of Orange over Catholic King James II in 1690. The season culminates in the 12 July celebration of William's victory at the Battle of the Boyne. Another tradition is the march every August of the Apprentice Boys, a ten-thousand-strong Protestant organisation which commemorates the defence of Londonderry against the forces of King James II in 1690.

In an incident known locally as 'The Rape of the Falls', 3000 British soldiers, acting on out-dated information and orders from Stormont, searched the Catholic Falls Road (in Belfast) for guns, explosives and ammunition.

The army wanted to contain the marchers in the Bogside and prevent them reaching the Guildhall, and so put up a number of barriers. As the crowd of marchers reached the barriers, the Parachute Regiment, apparently in the belief that it was under fire, opened fire on the crowd. The result was 14 deaths and 13 injured.

Resistance to British rule in Ireland had existed for
hundreds of years. Irish nationalists, the majority of them Catholic, resisted this rule in a number of peaceful or violent ways up until the start of the First World War. Irish nationalists wanted Ireland to be independent from British control. 
At the start of the twentieth century, Irish ‘Home Rule’, the name given to the process of transferring rule from British to Irish hands seemed likely and, as a result the Unionist minority, a largely Protestant population, loyal to Britain and British rule, began to more actively resist the idea. 
Eventually, Irish Home Rule was granted, but it excluded the six mainly Protestant counties of the province of Ulster (one of the four provinces of Ireland) in the north-east corner of the island.",825,136,1,1097,False

MPs in the Irish Parliamentary Party, led by John Redmond, had allied themselves with the Liberal Party, who broadly supported the cause of Irish Home Rule.

Teacher’s Notes
Irish Partition is a complex subject, especially because the historical background is so important to understand in order to make sense as to what happened in the early 1920s. The first source used in this lesson is a cartoon from 1910, which can be used to set up a discussion around the longer term conflict around Home Rule, in Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, i.e. that this was not a new issue immediately after the First World War, and that there was resistance to it.",948,158,13,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"this was not a new issue immediately after the First World War, and that there was resistance to it. The second source is an extract from the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which essentially sets up the Irish Free State, and continues down that road leading to partition. The next source discusses some of the concerns around the religious breakdown of Northern Ireland after partition, and some of the problems associated with that, many of which would (and still do) endure. The final source looks at this religious breakdown in more detail, showing some of the complexities associated with attempting to come up with a sustainable solution.

Background
Britain ruled over the island of Ireland for hundreds of years and, during that time, there had, to varying degrees, always been some form of resistance to that rule. This was either demonstrated through violence, or through politicians taking up issues in Parliament. 
Broadly speaking, there were two political viewpoints in Ireland.",894,138,16,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"s taking up issues in Parliament. 
Broadly speaking, there were two political viewpoints in Ireland. Irish nationalists, most of them from the majority Catholic population, had attempted on a number of occasions to bring about Home Rule for Ireland, and this idea started to gain momentum and became a real possibility during the last decades of the 19th century. MPs in the Irish Parliamentary Party, led by John Redmond, had allied themselves with the Liberal Party, who broadly supported the cause of Irish Home Rule. Eventually, after a third attempt to pass through Parliament, Home Rule became law in 1914. 
There was also a large Protestant minority in Ireland, located largely in the north-eastern county of Ulster, who believed that Ireland should remain as part of the United Kingdom. These Unionists actively resisted calls for Home Rule, fearful that, as a Protestant minority, should Home Rule be granted, they would be ruled by a Catholic majority.",962,156,17,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,", as a Protestant minority, should Home Rule be granted, they would be ruled by a Catholic majority. 
Both sides reached the brink of civil war in 1914. The question of Home Rule was suspended for the duration of the First World War, but immediately came back on the agenda at the end of hostilities. So called Advanced Nationalists, led by the now dominant Sinn Fein, had won most of the seats at the 1918 General Election and had decided to establish their own Parliament in Dublin. 
Conflict once again occurred, the Irish War of Independence lasting over two years, until the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 which brought it to a close and established the Irish Free State. Not long before this, the Government of Ireland Act 1920, had also allowed for the creation of a separate Parliament in Northern Ireland, which came into being in June 1921, essentially partitioning the island of Ireland.",918,158,18,1097,False

My Lord, 
May I take the liberty of making a suggestion to you – solely in the interest of peace in this part of the world. 
The root cause of the trouble here is that the Catholics and the Nationalists feel that Ulster was unfairly divided by the 1920 Act. The opposition of Ulster (all Ulster) was used as an argument against Home Rule, but when it came to forming a separate Government here, all Ulster was not taken as a unit, it was cut up in such a way as to empower 820,000 Protestants to rule over 420,000 Catholics. The result being that Catholics will not enter the Northern Parliament. If all Ulster had been taken as a unit, there would have been 890,000 Protestants as against 690,000 Catholics.",810,147,21,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"er had been taken as a unit, there would have been 890,000 Protestants as against 690,000 Catholics. This would have enabled Catholics to form a strong minority in the Northern Parliament so strong that they could have protected themselves fairly well and perhaps in the near future, with the aid of liberal minded Protestants, to get into office as happens in England and other civilised countries. As it is 
Catholics see no hope of anything save being ruled for all time by their hereditary enemies. This to them is an intolerable state of affairs. Sir James Craig told a friend of mine lately that to induce Catholics to enter his Parliament he would be willing to give them representation in proportion to their numbers in the six counties. This is a move in the right direction.",784,136,22,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"sentation in proportion to their numbers in the six counties. This is a move in the right direction. 
Could you not appoint some outstanding English statesman, in whom both sides would have confidence, as a special commissioner to arrange the matter, just as the British Government appointed Lord Durham in 1867 to settle the Canadian difficulty? 
There is no great affection between Northern Catholics and South Catholics and if Northern Catholics were treated fairly, they would support the Northern Parliament.

January 1910 and December 1910 with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party led by 
John Redmond. Liberals did not have a majority of seats in the House of Commons and the Irish Parliamentary Party held the balance of power in Parliament. They were in a strong position to push for Home Rule.",915,152,24,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"Party held the balance of power in Parliament. They were in a strong position to push for Home Rule.
Irish Home Rule was finally granted in 1914, but was delayed because of the start of the First World War, and partly also because Unionists, especially in the north-eastern province of Ulster, were not happy with this outcome, and continued to threaten civil war.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"1921, Catalogue ref: DO 118/51
Immediately after the First World War, Home Rule was further delayed. Therefore, Irish nationalists led by Sinn Fein, meaning ‘we ourselves’, an Irish Republican party, took up 
13
arms against British rule. This would become the Irish War of Independence.
After over two years of fighting, a treaty was finally signed in late 1921, which set out terms for an Irish Free State, free from direct British rule.
According to the Treaty, the Irish Free State will have the same status [position] to which other countries? [Point 1]
What powers will the Irish Free State now have? [Point 1]
Who does Point 3 say will be the British (Crown) representative in Ireland?
Do you think that all sides (in Britain and Ireland) found this result acceptable?
If not, who might still be dissatisfied with these terms and why?
Task Three

When Northern Ireland was formed in 1920, it was decided, partly because of where Catholic and Protestant populations lived, to only include six of the nine counties of Ulster within the new state. Thus, the remaining three counties eventually formed part of the Irish Free State.
What does the author of the letter say was the main reason for the trouble which still existed in the country?
What was the result of Ulster being divided like this in terms of the religious makeup of the people living there?
What does the author of the letter suggest as a possible solution?
Task Four 
Look at Source 4 - Map of Northern Ireland showing the religious breakdown taken from the 
Irish Boundary Commission, Catalogue ref: MPI 1/402

I am willing to go so far as that; that is only detail. But on the essentials, I am for publicity now and all along. May I just put one point right?

Extracts from Michael Collins’s speeches during the Treaty Debates (continued)
19 December 1921
I also want to explain to you as one of the signatories what I consider rejection of it means. It has been said that the alternative document does not mean war. Perhaps it does, perhaps it does not. That is not the first part of the argument. I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war. If you do this, if you go on that as a national policy, I for one am satisfied. But I want you to go on it as a national policy and understand what it means. I, as an individual, do not now, no more than ever, shirk war.

Now, in all countries in times of change—when countries are passing from peace to war or war to peace—they have had their most trying times on an occasion like this. Whether we are right or whether we are wrong in the view of future generations there is this: that we now are entitled to a chance; all the responsibility will fall upon us of taking over the machinery of government from the enemy.

Extracts from Éamon de Valera’s speeches during the Treaty Debates
14 December 1921
I am looking after the interests of Ireland. If there is anything wrong in this Treaty and if this Treaty be ratified, I want, at least, to see that we don’t be held up as fools. We don’t want Lloyd George again to trick us. I don’t want the British Government to trick us. I won’t trust them. There is an old saying, “Is mairg a bhíos go holc agus bhíos bocht na dhiadh” and I say that because I do distrust them and not because I want to attack anybody here. I have the highest possible respect for my colleagues, every one of them.",981,154,38,1097,False

There is not one of those men who is not the soul of honour and who is not doing his best for Ireland, and I am fighting now not to be beaten by the politicians in England and by English statesmen. We want to prevent ourselves being tricked by England. We want at least to get something and not to be a laughing stock if it is accepted. www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-14/3/#spk_340

I am once more asking you to reject the Treaty for two main reasons, that, as every Teachta knows, it is absolutely inconsistent with our position; it gives away Irish independence; it brings us into the British Empire; it acknowledges the head of the British Empire, not merely as the head of an association, but as the direct monarch of Ireland, as the source of executive authority in Ireland.",996,171,39,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"association, but as the direct monarch of Ireland, as the source of executive authority in Ireland.
The Ministers of Ireland will be His Majesty’s Ministers, the Army that Commandant MacKeon spoke of will be His Majesty’s Army. (Voices: “No.”) You may sneer at words, but I say words mean, and I say in a Treaty words do mean something, else why should they be put down? They have meanings and they have facts, great realities that you cannot close your eyes to. This Treaty means that the Ministers of the Irish Free State will be His Majesty’s Ministers (cries of “No, no,”) and the Irish Forces will be His Majesty’s Forces (“No, no.”) Well, time will tell, and I hope it won’t have a chance, because you will throw this out. www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/#spk_18

An attempt has been made, not by President de Valera but outside, to make it appear that we went there with more or less definite instructions to take a Republic and nothing but a Republic, whereas we were sent there to do our best, in effect to make a bargain. In a speech at the Dáil on August 17th. Mr. de Valera, spoke of mutual give and take, said they were ready to meet and adjust this on the basis of mutual give and take. In the same speech he said. “If it was demanded of me that before going to negotiate with the British Prime Minister I would first of all have to renounce our independent right I would not have gone.",826,155,43,1097,False

If, on the other hand, seeing the claim that they are putting forward I made a demand before I went, that Britain ought to acknowledge our right absolutely then I might have been held to be unreasonable because then there would have been no question of, or necessity for, negotiations”. Once you start negotiations you are going to give away something and you are going to get something. At the general election the question was put to the Irish people to say what form of Government they wanted how they wished to live so that they might have an opportunity of working out for themselves their own national life in their own way and the answer the people gave was unmistakable. “I do not take it”, said the President, “for the form so much because we are not Republican doctrinaires as such. It was for Irish freedom and Irish independence”.",943,169,44,1097,False

Well, we have brought back Irish freedom and Irish independence (No, no and question). Ireland is as free as Canada and Australia (No). I don’t mind the members arguing with me. I object to being interrupted. We say and we contend that we have brought back a satisfactory answer. It is for the representatives to decide whether we have not but let them argue it out hereafter. If we were to bring back the full demand we would not have been sent at all.

There was a lot of talk when the Treaty was brought back, but if we present to the world to-morrow a united front then the country will follow us.

If they declared war on us to-morrow we are not a bit worse off than we were six months ago. For God’s sake and the sake of the dead let us keep together. We who stand for principle cannot give in to you who stand for expediency, and expediency can always give way to principle.

INTRODUCTION 
The year 1922 in Ireland was pivotal; it witnessed three major events that ushered in the final phase of Ireland’s revolution – the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty leading to the establishment of the Irish Free State, the final confirmation of partition when Northern Ireland opted out of that Free State settlement, and the outbreak of the Irish Civil War. 
This teaching resource is based on Ireland 1922: Independence, Partition, Civil War (edited 
by Darragh Gannon and Fearghal McGarry. Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, 2022), which consists of fifty concise and illustrated essays, each of which addresses a particular event that took place in 1922 to explore a broader theme related to the Irish revolution or its legacy.",881,130,60,1097,False

This resource pack has been designed for the Leaving Certificate Late Modern History (1815– 1993) course, supporting Later Modern Ireland and particularly Topic 3, ‘The pursuit of sovereignty and the impact of partition, 1912–1949’.
This resource consists of four topics, each of which comprises an exam-style documents-based question, supplemental primary source material, and historiographical interpretations from Ireland 1922. This will allow students to engage with and build upon the existing course material with its emphasis on enquiry, evidence and exploration and to develop the ability to debate the usefulness and limitations of different types of primary and secondary sources of historical evidence. Students will require an awareness of the key events in Ireland during the Revolutionary period (1916–23) to orientate them when reading through the documents.",974,145,61,1097,False

Teachers and students can choose which topic to focus on and how best to use it in the classroom.

However, by the beginning of 1922, Ireland once again faced the prospect of war. The AngloIrish Treaty, which had been signed in London on 6 December 1921 following two months of negotiations, was extremely divisive. It was ratified in the Dáil on 7 January 1922 by a vote of 64 to 57, following acrimonious Dáil debates. But its opponents refused to accept the treaty – Éamon de Valera resigned as president of the Dáil, to be replaced by Arthur Griffith, and thus triggered a split in the republican movement that spread from the Dáil to Sinn Féin and then the IRA, eventually leading to the Irish Civil War (28 June 1922 – 24 May 1923).
1922 was a confusing, unsettled and unsettling, year, when things did not turn out as hoped. There was still much to play for at the outset, but it ended in violence and disillusionment.",928,163,63,1097,False

It was marked by acts of violence north and south of the border, and while the War of Independence had come to an end, it was unclear what kind of state would emerge from it, with what level of independence. Many of the issues would not be settled for years or decades, and some remain unresolved.
It was a year of enormous change: its events cemented partition and established the Irish Free State which, in turn, provided the basis for the Ireland that Éamon de Valera went on to create.

The seven-member Dáil cabinet voted to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil by a margin of four to three: Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Robert Barton and W.T. Cosgrave voted in favour, while Éamon de Valera, Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack voted against. 
As the Dáil debated the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the University College Dublin lecture theatre at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin’s city centre became incredibly tense. The Dáil debates have long been seen as a climactic point in the history of the Irish revolution; they were the moment when the camaraderie of the republican movement was fractured and the bitterness and divisions of the civil war began.",773,126,68,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ie of the republican movement was fractured and the bitterness and divisions of the civil war began.
These debates have been the focus for many historians, with particular attention being paid to the constitutional arguments both for and against the proposed treaty, and the gender dynamics, with the majority of female speakers in opposition, and, latterly, the class dimensions of the treaty split. But alongside these questions, the most noted feature of the Treaty Debates was the tone of the exchanges.
Ultimately, on 7 January 1922, the Dáil voted to approve the treaty by a vote of 64 to 57 but its opponents refused to accept this result, leading eventually to the Irish Civil War.

The range of emotions of the treaty debates formed a significant part of how the Irish public learned about the emerging split in the republican movement. Despite the bitterness which was the abiding memory of the debates, the emotion most frequently expressed in the debates themselves was love – of Ireland, and of each other. But fear was present too: it stalked the chamber. The prospect of a split and of dividing the political community which had been forged through the revolutionary process was uppermost in deputies’ minds. Some accused their opponents of being motivated by fear, while others were adamant that the people in Ireland were steadfast and fearless in spite of the terror that was waged against them. 
In this pressure-cooker atmosphere, feelings bubbled over and passions ran high. This fevered emotional environment also was reflected in the tone of many of the speeches.",997,160,80,1097,False

A feature of the disintegration of republican unity in the months leading up to the outbreak of civil war is the spilling over into the public sphere of these emotions – recrimination, anger, accusations of bad faith, pragmatism, and hope.

THE BELFAST ‘POGROMS’ 
AND THE McMAHON MURDERS
INTRODUCTION 
Against the backdrop of partition and the intensification of the War of Independence in the South, violence erupted in Belfast in the early 1920s, with almost 500 people killed in the city between July 1920 and July 1922. Unlike in the rest of Ireland, however, the violence in Belfast consisted largely of urban rioting, with almost 80 per cent of the victims being civilians, as opposed to members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) or the security forces. Despite the signing of the truce on 11 July 1921, violence intensified in Belfast that summer, the brunt of it borne by the local Catholic community, which constituted 25 per cent of the city’s population.",962,155,85,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"of it borne by the local Catholic community, which constituted 25 per cent of the city’s population. 
While Belfast’s middle-class constitutional nationalists hoped that a policy of ‘recognition’ of the Northern parliament and its government would result in an end to persecution, this view was entirely out of step with the experiences of Catholics in working-class areas of the city, given events on the ground. From January 1922, the IRA launched a campaign to destabilise Northern Ireland; its attacks on the security forces were frequently met with vicious reprisals from loyalists who targeted Catholic communities in Belfast. In February 1922, the IRA ambush and killing of A Specials in Monaghan led to loyalist attacks on IRA-reinforced Catholic districts, and in March the situation deteriorated further with intimidation, house burning, rioting and assassinations.",875,132,86,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"rch the situation deteriorated further with intimidation, house burning, rioting and assassinations. 
The attack that shocked contemporaries most was the murder of a prosperous Catholic publican, Owen McMahon, together with four of his sons (aged between 15 and 26 years) and a barman who was present during the attack at the family’s home in north Belfast in the early hours of 24 March 1922. The killings were seen by many as a reprisal for the shooting of two policemen (of the Ulster Special Constabulary) the day before. News of the attack reverberated throughout Ireland and beyond.

For some time, Joe Devlin, MP for West Belfast and leading nationalist politician in the north, had been protesting about Crown force involvement in the killing of Catholics.

INTRODUCTION 
At 2.20 p.m. on Thursday 22 June Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, chief security advisor to the new Northern Irish government and former Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was shot dead on the doorstep of his Belgravia home in London by IRA Commandant Reggie Dunne and Volunteer Joe O’Sullivan.

It also hastened the onset of the Irish Civil War as the British government placed responsibility for Wilson’s killing on the anti-Treaty sections of the IRA, who had been occupying the Four Courts in Dublin since April 1922 in defiance of the pro-Treaty Provisional Government led by Michael Collins. Winston Churchill warned Collins that British troops would move against the IRA leadership at the Four Courts, whose presence there he considered a violation of the Treaty, if the Provisional Government themselves failed to act. 
Reluctantly, Collins ordered Free State troops to attack the Four Courts on 28 June 1922, with the aid of British artillery.

Extract from Fearghal McGarry, ‘An Irish Tragedy: The assassination of Sir Henry Wilson’, Ireland 1922: Independence, Partition, Civil War (Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, 2021)
Dunne and O’Sullivan claimed in court that their actions were a spontaneous response to the Ulster Special Constabulary’s reign of ‘Orange Terror’ against Belfast Catholics, which they (wrongly) blamed on Wilson. Republicans in London believed the killing had been ordered – whether as an IRA or IRB operation, before or after the Truce – by Michael Collins.
Wilson, who epitomised British imperial repression in Ireland, was born in Longford. His IRA killers were Londoners. All had served in the same army during the First World War, where O’Sullivan had lost a leg.

Addressing his jury, he attributed his actions in part to his role in the war fought for the right of small nations to self-determination. Wilson belonged to a Protestant, landowning, unionist family, and embodied an imperial Irish tradition that would not survive the revolutionary era. 
Wilson’s fate exemplifies one of the era’s most enduring legacies: the narrowing of identities caused by political violence. Family experiences often diverged sharply from the political narratives which framed the public memory of the revolutionary dead. Although David Lloyd George reminded Westminster of his friendship with Wilson, his ministers were denounced as murderers by Lady Wilson whose diehard husband never forgave their willingness to settle with the IRA.",859,131,119,1097,False

Despite Wilson’s regret at the sundering of the Union with Ireland, he was quickly claimed by Ulster Unionists as a ‘founding martyr for the Northern Ireland state’. 
In contrast, despite the insistence of witnesses across the Civil War divide that they had acted on orders received, and the argument that the Irish government had ‘a certain moral responsibility’, neither Dunne nor O’Sullivan’s parents were judged to meet the criteria for the allowance paid to dependents of Volunteers who died in military service. 
On 8 July 1967, following a campaign for the return of their remains, Dunne and O’Sullivan finally received a public funeral befitting their status as heroic patriots. In Belfast, Ian Paisley roused a ‘great Protestant demonstration’ to protest Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s decision to return the remains: ‘While Dublin honours the murderers Belfast honours the martyr’.",992,154,120,1097,False

THE EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN IN THE NEW FREE STATE
INTRODUCTION 
The Anglo-Irish Treaty brought a limited form of independence to most of Ireland and led not only to civil war but also, to an extent, to the demise of revolutionary ideals. 
Under the terms of the new Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann), 1922, the future for women in the Irish state looked bright. Article 3 of the Constitution guaranteed the equal rights of ‘every person, without distinction of sex’, while the parliamentary franchise had been extended to women on equal terms with men, six years before women in the United Kingdom could claim such a victory. Feminist activists were therefore, unsurprisingly, optimistic about the future of Irishwomen.",840,135,123,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ctory. Feminist activists were therefore, unsurprisingly, optimistic about the future of Irishwomen. 
But despite these promises of equality, Irish women’s citizenship in the Free State came to be defined by life in the home, marriage and motherhood, culminating in Article 41 of the 1937 Bunreacht na hÉireann (Constitution), which stated that:
In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.
For many, little changed in the Free State; for some, things had got worse.

Extract from a letter from Betty Archdale of the Six Point Group in London (a feminist organisation) to Éamon de Valera in response to his proposed Constitution of Ireland, 14 June 1937 (National Archives of Ireland, TSCH/S9880)
When the Irish Free State adopted her 1923 [sic] Constitution women felt elated at the recognition of the equality of men and women in Article 3. You can, therefore, imagine our sense of dismay at the clauses in the draft constitution, particularly clauses 40, 41.2 and 45.4.ii.",927,152,133,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"sense of dismay at the clauses in the draft constitution, particularly clauses 40, 41.2 and 45.4.ii. These clauses are based on a fascist and slave conception of woman as being a non-adult person who is very weak and whose place is in the home. Ireland’s fight for freedom would not have been so successful if Irish women had obeyed these clauses. You who have fought all your life for the freedom of your Country can surely not wish to deprive Irish women of the freedom for which they also have fought. If you would only help women to be free instead of clamping these tyrannous restrictions on them you would be doing a great service to women and to Ireland.

Why did the Constitution of the Irish Free State (1922) appeal to women?

Extract from Lindsey Earner-Byrne, ‘Gender and poverty in the new Free State’, Ireland 1922:

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"n, Civil War (Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, 2021)
On the 4 March 1922 Mrs Anna Lalor was heartbroken. Little had changed in the previous two years for her family of nine; if anything, things had got worse. Indeed, on this morning she felt compelled to sit down in her overcrowded two-roomed house in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, to write to one of the most powerful men in her universe – the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Edward Byrne (1921–1940). Her letter is but one among thousands the Archbishop received: these letters represent an extensive archive of the experience of poverty in the first two decades of Irish independence. 
Prior to marriage Mrs Lalor had been a domestic servant, an occupation she shared with one in three single women. In 1907, she left the formal workplace to marry, thereby entering a period in her life when little was within her control, not her fertility nor the waxing and waning of her husband’s earning capacity.",956,163,136,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"s within her control, not her fertility nor the waxing and waning of her husband’s earning capacity. The meaning of this impotence must have become apparent quite quickly to her: within four years she had birthed three children, almost one a year. By 1922 Anna had seven children. 
Her husband was forced to go to England; the bricklayers’ strike in Dublin that had lasted between October 1920 and June 1921 had only secured the workers a temporary increase of 1d. [penny] per hour, while ‘keeping the city’s modest slum clearance programme on hold.’ That outcome was indicative of the false promise of political independence for the new Ireland’s poorest citizens. While the President of the Executive, William T. Cosgrave, oversaw welfare cuts, including to the Old Age Pension, he drew an annual salary of £2,500. The average industrial wage was £126 per annum.",864,143,137,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"Old Age Pension, he drew an annual salary of £2,500. The average industrial wage was £126 per annum.
The new state promoted with vigour the stay-at-home mother as the bedrock of society, however, women like Mrs Lalor could rarely afford such idealism. The poor continued to survive through seasonal migration and emigration largely to England. Mrs Lalor articulated the emotional cost of that strategy, deftly connecting it with a sense that political freedom was a ruse that would not feed her children. 
Mrs Lalor’s letter provides barely a hint of the violence and uncertainty swirling around her country for she represents the continuity of human experience, which does not always beat to the rhythm of historical periodisation. The challenge of feeding a family changed little for women like her. During her lifetime the structure and trajectory of social inequality remained largely unchanged: the children of the poor continued to be the parents of the disadvantaged.",974,155,138,1097,False

Resistance to British rule in Ireland had existed for
hundreds of years. Irish nationalists, the majority of them Catholic, resisted this rule in a number of peaceful or violent ways up until the start of the First World War. Irish nationalists wanted Ireland to be independent from British control. 
At the start of the twentieth century, Irish ‘Home Rule’, the name given to the process of transferring rule from British to Irish hands seemed likely and, as a result the Unionist minority, a largely Protestant population, loyal to Britain and British rule, began to more actively resist the idea.",955,154,145,1097,False

Eventually, Irish Home Rule was granted, but it excluded the six mainly Protestant counties of the province of Ulster (one of the four provinces of Ireland) in the north-east corner of the island. This established Northern Ireland in 1920, which continued to be part of the United
Kingdom, while the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed in December 1921, established the Irish Free State as a Dominion of the British Empire. This meant that the Irish Free State was a selfgoverning nation of the
Commonwealth of Nations (

Background
Britain ruled over the island of Ireland for hundreds of years and, during that time, there had, to varying degrees, always been some form of resistance to that rule. This was either demonstrated through violence, or through politicians taking up issues in Parliament. 
Broadly speaking, there were two political viewpoints in Ireland. Irish nationalists, most of them from the majority Catholic population, had attempted on a number of occasions to bring about Home Rule for Ireland, and this idea started to gain momentum and became a real possibility during the last decades of the 19th century. MPs in the Irish Parliamentary Party, led by John Redmond, had allied themselves with the Liberal Party, who broadly supported the cause of Irish Home Rule.",960,157,147,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"d, had allied themselves with the Liberal Party, who broadly supported the cause of Irish Home Rule. Eventually, after a third attempt to pass through Parliament, Home Rule became law in 1914. 
There was also a large Protestant minority in Ireland, located largely in the north-eastern county of Ulster, who believed that Ireland should remain as part of the United Kingdom. These Unionists actively resisted calls for Home Rule, fearful that, as a Protestant minority, should Home Rule be granted, they would be ruled by a Catholic majority. 
Both sides reached the brink of civil war in 1914. The question of Home Rule was suspended for the duration of the First World War, but immediately came back on the agenda at the end of hostilities. So called Advanced Nationalists, led by the now dominant Sinn Fein, had won most of the seats at the 1918 General Election and had decided to establish their own Parliament in Dublin.",926,157,148,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"the seats at the 1918 General Election and had decided to establish their own Parliament in Dublin. 
Conflict once again occurred, the Irish War of Independence lasting over two years, until the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 which brought it to a close and established the Irish Free State. Not long before this, the Government of Ireland Act 1920, had also allowed for the creation of a separate Parliament in Northern Ireland, which came into being in June 1921, essentially partitioning the island of Ireland. 
Teachers' notes
Irish Partition is a complex subject, especially because the historical background is so important to understand in order to make sense as to what happened in the early 1920s. The first source used in this lesson is a cartoon from 1910, which can be used to set up a discussion around the longer term conflict around Home Rule, in Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, i.e.",925,157,149,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ion around the longer term conflict around Home Rule, in Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, i.e. that this was not a new issue immediately after the First World War, and that there was resistance to it. The second source is an extract from the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which essentially sets up the Irish Free State, and continues down that road leading to partition. The next source discusses some of the concerns around the religious breakdown of Northern Ireland after partition, and some of the problems associated with that, many of which would (and still do) endure. The final source looks at this religious breakdown in more detail, showing some of the complexities associated with attempting to come up with a sustainable solution.",738,123,150,1097,False

Starter Activity
Teachers could use the lesson ‘illustration image’ at top as a starter activity to introduce the topic of Home Rule for Ireland, or use it to build an understanding of the struggle for Home
Rule before the Irish Treaty and Government of Ireland Act. The cartoon also references John Redmond who features in the carton for Source 1. Teachers could discuss with students the meaning of the cartoon. 
What is happening in the cartoon? 
Who are the different people featured? 
What do you think the artist is trying to say about Irish Home Rule? 
What can we infer about Lord Rosebery’s attitude to Home Rule? 
What are the advantages /disadvantages of using political cartoons as evidence for the past? 
Teachers can explain that the Earl of Rosebery was a staunch upholder of the British
Empire.",911,152,151,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"past? 
Teachers can explain that the Earl of Rosebery was a staunch upholder of the British
Empire. He led the Liberal party until Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman took over as Prime
Minister in 1905-1908 and was never part of government from then onwards. Sir Edward Grey was Foreign Secretary 1905-1916. The donkey is ‘labelled’ with the letters ‘C.B’ to represent Henry Campbell-Bannerman who supported Home Rule, the animal has been drawn with his face. The man carrying the basket of feed for the animal, which is labelled
‘Irish votes’, probably represents John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. 
All documents are provided with transcripts. Students can work through the questions individually or in pairs and report back to the class. It is worth considering with students what other sources could help us understand the situation in Ireland before, during, and after partition.

The history of Ireland and Northern Ireland can be traced back long before its formation in 1921. To get to the heart of the history of Northern Ireland, we must go all the way back to 1167, with the Anglo-Norman intervention in Ireland. This is a pivotal point in history, as it is the first time that England properly established itself in Ireland. The mixing between the Irish and English was not all aggressive, but there was a distinct divide between the two.
During the reign of Henry VIII, specifically during his split from Rome, things got more heated in Ireland as religion became a huge part of Irish politics. Following this, in 1534, there was a show of rebellion against the British Crown as Lord Offaly, the heir to Kildare, headed a catholic revolt against the Protestant English King in Ireland. The revolt was unsuccessful, though. It was quickly squashed and all of those involved were killed.",915,159,157,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"The revolt was unsuccessful, though. It was quickly squashed and all of those involved were killed. This sparked a pattern of revolts in Ireland against English rule, but none were overly successful.
Throughout the reign of Elizabeth I, a range of plantations were established across Ireland, which heightened the tensions between the two countries even further. These plantations were created by confiscating land from Irish Landowners and giving them to colonists from England, Scotland, and Wales. These plantations continued to be put in place, the last of them being established while Oliver Cromwell was in power in the 1650s. These plantations were not just offensive to the Irish landowners, but they completely changed the structure of the population in Ireland. Large communities of English Protestants began to form, who were in opposition to the Roman Catholic Irish inhabitants.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"Irish inhabitants.
Whilst Oliver Cromwell was in power, violence, and conflict in Ireland were rife. Cromwell instigated a number of gruesome battles in the country, which resulted in many deaths on both sides.
By the end of the seventeenth century, the Catholic population of Ireland was extremely marginalised, and the conflict between the Protestants and Catholics was worse than ever. This culminated in the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690, in which the Catholic King, James II, was defeated by the Protestant King, William III. This battle solidified the
Protestants as the dominant side in Ireland and led to further oppression of Irish Catholics. This oppression involved lands being taken away, restricted rules in terms of education and the right to bear arms, the removal of Catholic clergy members, and more. The outraged Irish Catholic community began a reform movement, which marks the first real sight of Irish nationalism.",934,149,159,1097,False

The penal laws oppressing the Irish Catholics were eventually relaxed a bit, but the persecution continued. Conflicts and rebellions continued in the years to come, with the Protestant and Catholic populations of Ireland constantly at odds.
The already tenuous relationship between England and Ireland was worsened by the potato famine in 1840. The British government’s reaction to the potato famine was relaxed and ultimately unhelpful, despite the fact that it was devastating the Irish population. By 1851, the population in Ireland had dropped by around 2 million as a result of deaths, disease, and emigration.

When was Northern Ireland formed? — The early 20th century
By the time the 20th century rolled around, the climate in Ireland was much changed. A range of groups formed in the country, all aimed at maintaining the native Irish culture through various pastimes and the Gaelic language. Not everyone in Ireland was in favour of Independent Irish rule, however, as many opposed it both within Parliament and outside of it. The Protestant population of Ulster, in particular, were eager to keep their ties with Britain.
Armies of supporters rose up on both sides. Protestants, who were largely known as unionists, established the Ulster Volunteer Force and Catholics, who were known as nationalists, set up the Irish Volunteers.",902,149,161,1097,False

The Easter Rising of 1916 was a huge milestone in the history of Irish nationalism. The rising ended in a British victory, with the leaders of the rebellion being rounded up and executed. However, this made martyrs of the Irish rebels and spurred the nationalists on even more.
Further development
On the 21st of January 1919, the Dáil Éireann was established. The Dáil Éireann was an Irish Assembly formed by 73 Sinn Féin candidates who were elected for government but refused to attend Westminster. This heightened tensions even further, and conflict soon broke out.

This Act split the Ireland of Ireland into the North and South divide that we have today. The six, largely Protestant counties in Ulster became a part of the North, and the remaining 26 counties became a part of the South. The South was thereby known as the ‘Irish Free Zone’, which had its own dominion status within the British Commonwealth. It still did not have full independence, however, as this would not be granted until 1937.
In 1937, the Constitution was put in place, which abolished the Irish Free State and Eire, which means Ireland, was established as an independent, sovereign state.
The Troubles

Those campaigning for the end of partition were known as republicans, and those in favour of maintaining British rule were known as loyalists.
The majority of people on both sides of this conflict did not support the use of violence in furthering their respective campaigns. However, some did see the need for violence, and a bloody civil war broke out in Northern Ireland.

The Good Friday Agreement, which is also known as the Belfast Agreement, was signed on the 10th of April 1998 and brought an end to the majority of the violence of the Troubles. This agreement was a huge step towards peace in Northern Ireland. The agreement had a range of different terms and conditions, and also created a number of different institutions between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Whilst the Good Friday Agreement did end a lot of the violence in Northern Ireland, the country is still not entirely at peace. Northern Ireland is currently in a period known as ‘The Peace Process’.",949,164,165,1097,False

The history of Ireland and Northern Ireland - Where do they stand now?
So, we’ve explored the convoluted, violent and complicated history of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but where does that leave us? Where do these two countries stand today?

Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is part of the United Kingdom. Although it is part of the collection of countries that make up the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland does still have its own government, which has a set of legal powers that allows it to operate independently of the government of the United Kingdom on certain matters.
This political setup is all thanks to a number of referendums that took place towards the end of the 1990s. From 1997 to 1998, referendums, which are public votes, were held in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales determining that the United Kingdom would transfer a number of powers to the national parliaments in each of its comprising countries.",795,133,167,1097,False

So, whilst it is part of the United Kingdom and subject to its government on many matters, including foreign affairs, defence and social security, Northern Ireland’s local politicians still make key decisions on how the country is governed.

Northern Ireland: 
Living with the Troubles
26 May 2023–7 January 2024 IWM London
The Troubles in Northern Ireland lasted from the 1960s through to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. It was a complex and multifaceted period of history with continued relevance to many people to this day. This teacher resource is designed to provide context for the new Imperial War Museums exhibition, Northern Ireland: Living with the Troubles and help facilitate discussion with your KS3+ class.
The exhibition explores four themes:
The Night of 27–28 June 1970

The Northern Ireland: Living with the Troubles exhibition is not intended as a comprehensive history of the Troubles. It focuses on a few key moments within the conflict and highlights the multiple different perspectives on what took place. There is often no single story that everyone involved can agree on. This exhibition utilises objects from the Imperial War Museums collections (including new acquisitions) and recently collected oral histories to emphasise these conflicting narratives.
This exhibition aims to encourage the visitor to engage with these differing perspectives, challenge their own preconceptions of the conflict and ultimately empathise with the stories of the real people who either lived through the conflict or were brought up in the aftermath.",910,140,171,1097,False

The Troubles can be a difficult conflict to untangle. The definitions provided below are not all encompassing but hopefully give an indication as to some of the key terminologies and groups discussed in this exhibition.
IDEOLOGIES
Sectarianism – A strong adherence to a particular sect (political, ethnic, or religious), often leading to conflict with those of different sects or holding different beliefs.
Loyalism – Allegiance to the British crown and the United Kingdom. Loyalism is primarily working class in nature.",939,152,172,1097,False

Unionism – The political policy of maintaining 
Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.
Irish Nationalism – A political movement that aims for a united Ireland through non-violent means.
The Orange Order – A protestant organisation, formed in 1795. Known for its ‘marching season’ that culminates in large scale parades on 12 July each year. The marches are often controversial and sometimes lead to violence between the marching bands and nationalist/republican communities.",996,154,173,1097,False

Armed Struggle – Irish republican principle of armed resistance to Britain. The desired outcome sees Britain leaving Ireland and the country united as a 32 county socialist republic.
COMBATANTS
Paramilitaries – A trained and organised armed force that is like an army but is unofficial and often illegal.
Below are a few of the main groups involved:
The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) 
– The main armed republican group during the Troubles. It split from the main IRA in 1969 over disputes around defence of catholic communities and the political direction of the IRA at the time.
The Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) 
– After the split in 1969 the remaining group became known as the Official IRA. They moved towards Marxist politics and away from armed struggle. Nevertheless, they continued to come into conflict with both the PIRA and the INLA.",964,155,174,1097,False

The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) – A splinter group who broke from the OIRA in 1974. They disagreed with abandoning the group’s armed campaign. Although destructive and deadly, they were often split by internal disagreements and feuds.
The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) – Formed in 1966 over a perceived threat the IRA would stage a major insurrection. One of the main loyalist groups active during the Troubles. Its membership provided many of those who would contribute to the peace process in 1998.
The Red Hand Commando (RHC) – A highly secretive loyalist paramilitary group formed in 1970. It was linked with the UVF and incorporated into that organisation, to some extent. However, it retained its own independent command structure.

The Ulster Defence Association (UDA) – The largest of the loyalist groups. Formed in 1970, it amalgamated many community defence groups formed in the wake of the Troubles. Although not an illegal organisation, it carried out shootings and bombings under the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters.
THE SECURITY FORCES
The British Army – Deployed in force in late 1969 in response to the start of the Troubles. Operation Banner (1969-2007) was the longest continuous deployment of British soldiers in British Army history. Their role was difficult, dangerous, and controversial.
The Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) – The largest regiment in the British Army, formed in 1970. The regiment only served in Northern 
Ireland and all its personnel were from Northern Ireland. It included both men and women in full and part time roles.

Please be advised that this timeline is not intended to detail every event which led to the Troubles. It aims to provide context for the Northern Ireland: Living with the Troubles exhibition by highlighting some of the key moments which laid the foundation for the later conflict.
1600s
In 1603, the 
English defeated an Irish alliance of chiefs and gained control of the whole of Ireland.

1700s
Due to systematic resettlement and land seizure, by 1703 90% of the land in Ireland was owned by Anglo-Irish nobility. The early years of the 1700s also marked the introduction of the Penal Laws, which severely restricted the rights and opportunities of Irish Catholics. This period of growing Protestant power was labelled the Protestant Ascendency. In response to this, by the end of the century a nationalist movement was growing amongst the Irish population, inspired by events in France and the USA.
1800s
On 1st January 1801, the Act of Union abolished the Irish parliament and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formally created. The first half of the 1800s saw mass evictions of Irish tenant farmers, protests and rising poverty levels in Ireland.",990,166,178,1097,False

1886–1912
Throughout the late 1800s and into the early 1900s efforts were made to reverse parts of the Act of Union and establish Home Rule in Ireland. The first and second Home Rule bills were defeated but the third was passed in 1912. However, the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 meant the change was never enforced. Protestant communities voiced their strong opposition to Home Rule and the Ulster Volunteer Force, a militia of over 100,000 men, was raised to resist it, by force if necessary.

Sinn Fein, a republican party, came to power and declared Ireland independent from Britain.

Firing into a crowd during a riot that had started in response to marches led by the Protestant Orange Order. Republican accounts state that the loyalists were the ones who started the violence by attacking St Matthews church, forcing them to defend themselves.

The heightened violence of the 1970s and 1980s
Although there had been violent altercations during the 1960s, it is during the 1970s and 1980s that the situation escalated significantly. Shootings, bombings and violent clashes became an all too frequent occurrence amongst the various groups involved in the dispute. In 1969, after the clash between republicans and loyalists in what came to be known as the ‘Battle of the Bogside’, the British Army was deployed to Northern Ireland as part of ‘Operation Banner’.",909,148,183,1097,False

This increased direct involvement from the British government was a controversial move and added a new dynamic to political tensions in the region throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Despite all this uncertainty, the audio testimonies and objects within this part of the exhibition provide glimpses of how normal life attempted to persevere despite these distinctly abnormal surroundings.
During the 1990s, the opposing groups in the conflict became more willing to negotiate. As the potential for a lasting peace grew, the restrictions on daily life were scaled back.

It also recognised Northern Ireland as part of the UK but established a principle of consent to this status. The UK agreed to recognise a united Ireland if a majority in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted for it in a referendum.

As a result, many who grew up in the aftermath of the conflict have continued to feel the effects upon their own lives.
Britain’s vote to leave the EU in 2016 gave rise to a renewed sense of uncertainly over the future of Northern Ireland and threatened to shake the peace brought about by the Good Friday Agreement.

Analysis: as Brexit comes down to the wire, a look at a previous costly trade dispute between the two countries
By John Gibney, Royal Irish Academy
The 'Economic War' is the name given to the acrimonious trade conflict between Ireland and Britain that lasted for much of the 1930s. It originally began as a dispute over the continued repayment of land annuities, which were repayments for loans granted to Irish farmers by the British exchequer under the land acts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Grassroots opposition to repaying these emerged in the 1920s and the cause was taken up as an election issue by Éamon de Valera's Fianna Fáil.
When the party came to power in 1932, they promptly refused to pay them.",849,148,193,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"on de Valera's Fianna Fáil.
When the party came to power in 1932, they promptly refused to pay them. The British response (which was primarily an attempt to get the money somehow) was to impose tariffs on a wide range of Irish agricultural produce, most especially live cattle and beef. Ireland retaliated with tariffs on imports of British manufactured goods and raw material. Jonathan Swift's call to burn everything British except their coal was dusted down, the Economic War began and it went on until 1938.
The trade war was of a piece with the more aggressive stance taken by Fianna Fáil to the British after 1932, as they sought to roll back the provisions of the 1921 treaty that had created the Irish Free State as a Dominion within the Commonwealth. On taking office, Fianna Fáil successfully embarked on a sustained attempt to undo Ireland's remaining connections to the British Empire, and this was the context that framed the Economic War.",952,162,194,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"remaining connections to the British Empire, and this was the context that framed the Economic War. 
But it was not just an economic weapon in a political armoury: Fianna Fáil genuinely believed that economic independence had to be the basis of future prosperity (and that the annuities were better spent in Ireland than in Britain). Their Cumann na nGaedheal predecessors had broadly favoured free trade but, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, many countries shifted towards protectionism. Ultimately a small economy like Ireland’s was not suited to this, so Irish officials unsuccessfully sought new markets in continental Europe and North America. The historic alignment of the Irish economy with that of Britain was shaped by geography as much as imperialism.",765,121,195,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"alignment of the Irish economy with that of Britain was shaped by geography as much as imperialism.
It is hard not to look back at the Economic War and think that barriers can inflict hardship
Land annuities were worth millions every year, but the severe stance of the British was prompted by a desire to undermine Fianna Fáil in the hope that a squeezed electorate would dispense with their services. In this, they were mistaken as Fianna Fáil solidified their vote. Larger farmers bore the brunt of the restrictions in the livestock trade, but many small farmers were insulated by new social welfare schemes. Large numbers of additional jobs were created in new industries by the end of the 1930s - ironically, many of these depended on British raw material. 
In 1934, there had been a small improvement in British-Irish relations with the 'coal-cattle pact', which ensured increases in both British imports of Irish livestock and Irish imports of British coal.",963,161,196,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"hich ensured increases in both British imports of Irish livestock and Irish imports of British coal. But the dismantling of the recently imposed tariffs and quotas between the two islands had to wait until the tripartite agreement of April 1938, which gave preferential access for Irish goods into the British market and vice versa.
While symbolically important as a marker of independence, the Economic War inevitably affected Irish farming producers more then the British consumers of their products: after all, the UK was the market for 90% of Ireland's exports. But the British government of Neville Chamberlain negotiated with one eye on the looming European war that was widely assumed to be on the horizon by the late 1930s. It was quite likely that Britain would need to depend upon Ireland as a traditional supplier of food once more.",843,139,197,1097,False

The Economic War ended before World War II began, and part of the settlement was a final resolution of the issue that had prompted it. The government of 'Éire' (as it was called on the final text) agreed to pay a £10 million lump sum as a final settlement of the annuities issue.",814,141,198,1097,False

Considering that the overall liability of the annuities could have been as high as £100 million – a sum that almost certainly outweighed the economic ‘hit’ suffered by the Irish economy – it was not, to use the parlance of our times, a bad deal.
Parallels, as someone once said, may well be pointless. But with issues such as sovereignty and trade relations in the ether at the end of 2020, it is hard not to look back at the Economic War and think that barriers can inflict hardship. International relations are a fact of geography as much as of wishful thinking, and everyone in their right mind comes to the table eventually as reality intrudes.

onomic- IFS and the UK, an issue that is a concern for countries currently contemplating leaving the nsequences-Union. Under article V of the Anglo-Irish Treaty (
-irish- of-the-articles-of-agreement-for-a-treaty-between-great-britain-and-ireland-asependencesigned/214/#section-documentpa) ge), the IFS was to assume liability for a fixed share of existing UK debt, estimated to have been 80% of IFS GDP (Fitzgerald and Kenny, 2020).
The IFS was subsequently released from this sizeable obligation as a concession for the acceptance of permanent partition of the island and the existing border (Fitzgerald and Kenny, 2020 ( The importance of the border issue was a uniquely Irish predicament; but comparison could be made with North Sea oil rese",1000,140,213,1097,False

There was, however, one other debt for which the IFS remained liable: the outstanding debts relating to bond-financed land purchase schemes in Ireland, roughly 40% of IFS GDP (Foley-
Fisher and McLaughlin, 2016
( Ireland was the only part of the UK where this policy was implemented and Offer (1983
( argues that the scale of the purchase programme had restricted government policies in other areas, such as education reform, in Britain.

The 1923 Land Act in the IFS was an attempt to complete land purchases (for example, the sale of land from landlords to tenant farmers) of the preindependence land acts, and it was reciprocated by the 1925 Land Act in Northern Ireland (Foley-Fisher and McLaughlin, 2016b (
Unlike the First National Loan, the IFS government could not have undertaken the 1923 Land Act without the assistance of the UK government. The latter had to agree with the contents of the legislation in order to secure a British guarantee on the £30 million loan for continued land purchases.

Currency and credit
Another important facet of early IFS policy was also picked up by The Economist, namely that it did not create a separate currency and ‘was in no hurry to establish one’. With a de facto common currency during the 1920s, the IFS and Northern Ireland shared a similar monetary experience (Daniel, 1976 ( The Irish pound was pegged to sterling and experienced comparable trials and tribulations with the restoration of gold at parity that was experienced in Britain, namely a fall in prices or deflationary pressures. This was because the IFS was required to adhere to ‘sound finance’ (balanced budgets). When Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, the IFS followed shortly afterwards – see Figure 2.",971,157,216,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"n abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, the IFS followed shortly afterwards – see Figure 2. The IFS pound was essentially a sterling-pegged currency until 1979 (Bielenberg and Ryan, 2012 (
Banking practices, such as the structure of bank assets and liabilities as well as branch banking, were unchanged from the pre-partition period. The creation of a political border did not result in the establishment of an ‘Irish’ (north or south) money market, and Irish banks continued to use the facilities of the London money market.
But from a technical standpoint, this now meant that IFS banks were exporting capital. Equities were traded on the Dublin Stock Exchange, but this was small and market capitalisation fell in both real and nominal terms from the early 1900s (Grossman et al, 2014 ( Later, the state investment bank, the Industrial Credit Corporation (established in 1933), played an important role in underwriting shares of new companies founded in the 1930s.",976,158,217,1097,False

Why was the IFS rigidly conservative about the possibilities of monetary change? There are several possible explanations. As most civil servants were in office prior to the establishment of the IFS and were trained by HM Treasury, perhaps there was little willingness or ability to deviate from conventional wisdom about currency (Johnson, 1985 (
In addition, there was an awareness of the importance of creating confidence in the new state and radical institutional change would have threatened business interests in Dublin. Contemporary events, such as the experience of hyperinflation, which drastically increased prices in post-First World War Europe, were an obvious deterrent to any monetary experimentation (Dáil debates, 27 January 1926

Protectionism, economic nationalism and a trade war
The election of Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, in February 1932 is traditionally seen as a moment of radical change in economic policy in the IFS because of the introduction of protectionism and economic nationalism. But the 1930s were characterised by three separate factors: the Great Depression; the Anglo-Irish ‘economic war’; and the implementation of protectionism. All three are interrelated and difficult to disentangle, making it hard to determine which factor had the greatest impact (Kennedy et al, 1989 (
The IFS had a delayed experience of the Great Depression. This is partly explained by the fact that it was primarily an agricultural producer specialising in livestock and had a limited manufacturing sector.",945,149,219,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"primarily an agricultural producer specialising in livestock and had a limited manufacturing sector. But the IFS (as well as the UK) were also helped by a stable financial system, one that did not experience a banking crisis.
More importantly, countries that left the gold standard earlier recovered from the depression more quickly (Eichengreen, 1996)
( Thus, by following British monetary policy, the IFS may have been spared a worse fate in the 1930s.
Despite this, rising unemployment coupled with a strain on employment in the United States and the UK – both traditional emigrant destinations – led to changes in economic policy. Import tariffs were introduced in November 1931 to prevent dumping, whereby products are exported at below normal prices. These tariffs echoed similar measures in the UK, which applied to Northern Ireland.",840,133,220,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"w normal prices. These tariffs echoed similar measures in the UK, which applied to Northern Ireland.
Protectionist policies were adopted by Fianna Fáil because at the time there was not much else the government could do given the self-imposed monetary constraints of the IFS. Protected industries – despite local lobbying – were primarily located around key ports as they were dependent on imported raw materials and the majority of employment was located in and around Dublin (Daly, 1992 ( Further efforts were made to increase employment in agriculture by encouraging the preparation of the land for crops, or tillage, but here too there were limited gains.

In June 1932, the IFS defaulted on obligations under the Anglo-Irish Treaty and subsequent financial settlements (Foley-Fisher and McLaughlin, 2016 ( These were primarily repayments of loan instalments by farmers under the pre-independence land acts, which in total amounted to £5 million per annum.
The British response to default on the annuity payments was to levy tariffs on IFS imports, most notably cattle, in an attempt to recoup the expense of servicing these debts. This action was motivated by the belief that by hurting Irish farmers, it would undermine the support base of Fianna Fáil. But the IFS immediately retaliated and imposed its own counter-tariffs.",770,125,222,1097,False

In all, the dispute did not harm Fianna Fáil’s electoral standing and the economic war gradually ended with bilateral trade agreements between the UK and the IFS in 1934 and then again in 1938 (O’Rourke, 1991 (
The political context of the annuities dispute helps to understand the underlying motives of the Fianna Fáil administration. They were part of a deliberate strategy to remove the remaining vestiges of the Treaty that were unpalatable to Fianna Fáil, including the Oath of Allegiance to the British Monarchy and the post of Governor General (McMahon, 1984 (

Ireland had to reduce social payments and live within its means in the years immediately following independence. This was because previous social payments had effectively been financed by the largesse of HM Treasury – although the question of whether this repayment was rightfully owed to Ireland is another issue. These levels were eventually restored thanks to a growing economy.
The early years of independence in Ireland was a time of cautious experimentation, but as Rumpf and Hepburn (1977 ( concluded, independence was ‘more directly concerned with securing the power of the nation to direct its own destiny than with achieving prosperity or social progress as such’.

I wanted to identify ways in which ideas based around literacy concepts could be used during history lessons, and vice versa, with the aim of extending literacy through history. I began by identifying the key literacy genre I wanted to introduce the children to (recount-writing, specifically diary-writing).
Then, using the QCA scheme of work as a starting point, I thought about how I could incorporate the recount genre into the history planning.
History: The Year 6 class undertook a range of activities. They examined photographic evidence; read a range of topic books about the war and the Blitz; watched a film about Merseyside during the war; listened to and questioned a grandmother who had been a child in the war; and visited the Stockport Air Raid Shelter.",869,144,229,1097,False

Literacy: The class novel was Goodnight, Mr Tom, and at the end of each day the class listened to an audio-taped episode from the novel. During guided reading the class read newspaper reports about air raids on Liverpool, paying particular attention to people’s comments to encourage empathy. We also read and discussed extracts from Anne Frank’s Diary during guided reading sessions. Linked to this, in drama we looked at ‘Dealing with being excluded’, bringing in a PSCHE element. We incorporated other cross-curricular elements too: in art the class completed observational drawings of war artefacts, and the children used ICT to search websites (e.g. the Imperial War Museum website) for information about aspects of World War II.

Learning objectives
History - for the children to:
develop understanding of how the bombing involved and affected ordinary people
to select evidence about the experiences and feelings of children during air raids from a wide range of information sources, and to communicate their understanding through a war diary based upon evidence.
Literacy – for the class to:

Key questions
What do you think would have happened during an air raid?
What do you think you would have felt, seen, smelt and done during an air raid?
What evidence can we use to help us write a reliable diary account?
Resources
Large (A3) sheets, post-its, planning sheets, felt tip pens.
We had used the following resources earlier in the history unit. During the three lessons described below, the class drew on their learning from these resources:
Story: Michelle Magorian’s 1981 novel Goodnight, Mr Tom (Viking
Press). We used the book itself, a video of the 1998 ITV film version Goodnight Mister Tom, starring John Thaw, and an audio-recording of the book. The video/DVD is available from Amazon, or can be watched online: see www.itv.com.

Oral history: Laura’s grandma visited the class to share her experiences.
Visit: we had a class trip to the Stockport Air Raid Shelter.
The teaching [Lesson 1]
Episode 1 Focus: Thinking about diaries; imagining an air raid.
We began by revisiting earlier learning. I asked the children: What makes a good diary account?’ Here we drew on the diary mind-map that we had completed during an earlier literacy hour. I told the class that in today’s lesson they would begin writing their own diary accounts, and this would be linked to our history topic work.
We had visited the Stockport Air Raid Shelter the previous day, so I next asked the children to close their eyes and imagine how it must have felt to be there during a real air raid.",896,154,233,1097,False

I then asked them to think of three things they had learnt from the visit to Stockport, and to share their thoughts with the person sitting to their left. Judging by the buzz of conversation they had learnt a lot!
To help the children who find imagining difficult, we now watched a short clip from the ITV film Goodnight Mister Tom – the episode where Mr Tom heard the air raid siren in London. Using the film clip as a stimulus, we discussed:
what the children saw; e.g. the air raid warden (What were hisresponsibilities?) • the sounds they heard
Mr Tom’s feelings, linking these to the feelings the children had hadthe previous day in Stockport.
The children’s responses drew on the film, the Stockport visit, and also on Laura’s grandma’s experiences. Some children also selected information from other sources looked at in class (books, newspapers, photos, artefacts).",974,169,234,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"o selected information from other sources looked at in class (books, newspapers, photos, artefacts).
Episode 2
Focus: Using the senses; language self-assessment; beginning diarywriting.
I put the class into mixed-sex pairs, and each pair wrote on post-it notes words and phrases that they could have heard, smelt, felt and done as they entered the air raid shelter after the siren had sounded. The class loved doing this, and filled scores of post-it notes.
Each pair then chose their favourite words/phrases and stuck them onto large sheets of A3 paper I had pinned to the wall. Once the A3 sheets were full, I challenged the class to look hard at their words and phrases and to think about which were likely to be the most authentic. These were the words/phrases they should consider including in their air raid diaries.
I now modelled to the children how I would begin my diary. Next I set the class, in their pairs, to write the beginnings of their own diaries.",965,166,235,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"begin my diary. Next I set the class, in their pairs, to write the beginnings of their own diaries. This they did for around 15 minutes.
In the plenary, each pair swapped work with another pair, and discussed what they could improve and what they liked.
The teaching [Lesson 2]
Episode 1
Focus: Editing first drafts of Blitz diaries.
The session began with recapping what we had completed in the previous lesson. I then modelled how to edit, because I had noticed that some children had found this difficult.
Then we watched another extract from the Goodnight Mister Tom film, this time covering being inside the air raid shelter. Afterwards we again had a class discussion about what they had seen in the film clip. This helped the children to articulate what they could see, feel and infer, and formed a valuable preparation for writing.
Episode 2
Focus: Using planning sheets.
After our discussion, we prepared for writing the next instalment of the air raid diaries.",970,166,236,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"g sheets.
After our discussion, we prepared for writing the next instalment of the air raid diaries. Instead of using post-its, the children jotted down ideas straight onto planning sheets. Today I made the paired children swap roles, so that it wasn’t the same child always writing.
The children wrote for twenty minutes. This gave me the opportunity to work with two struggling pairs for ten minutes each.
The teaching [Lesson 3]
Episode 1
Focus: Discussing feelings; using evidence to justify answers.
Today we moved on to stage three of the diary narrative: leaving the air raid shelter. As before, we began by watching a film clip, this time of Mr Tom leaving the air raid shelter.
Then, sitting in a circle, the children took it in turns to say what emotions Mr Tom must have been feeling, and used this as a starting point to discuss how a child would have felt. The children had to justify their conclusions by referring to historical information.",955,165,237,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"uld have felt. The children had to justify their conclusions by referring to historical information.
We related this discussion back to the senses the children had recorded on their planning sheets in the previous lesson.
Episode 2
Focus: Completing diary accounts.
I now talked about what I would include in my diary and modelled my ending to the class. The children now spent about 15 minutes completing their air raid diary accounts.
Episode 3
Focus: Plenary – judging the reliability of diary accounts.
In the plenary, the children read aloud their diary accounts and provided one another with constructive criticism. The children had to state where they had selected their information from, and whether they thought it was reliable.
I was pleased to see that the children also noticed how different many of the accounts were. This clearly helped them to understand that not everyone had the same story to tell of the war – that interpretations, perceptions and experiences of events could vary.",999,164,238,1097,False

Learning outcomes
The children:
developed an understanding of what it was like to experience an air raid
were able to move imaginatively into the past and see it through the eyes of those who lived through the war
completed diary accounts in the recount genre containing relevant and authentically-based historical information.
Reflection
I spent more than the allocated time on this one area of the QCA topic, and I was glad that I had. The benefits were immense, as the children really got their teeth into the topic. They read around the subject, brought in books from the library and researched on the internet.
The topic also improved home-school links: grandparents were willing to share experiences and parents brought in artefacts they had at home.
The link to historical fiction also proved to be invaluable.",918,152,239,1097,False

The link to historical fiction also proved to be invaluable. The children found it easy to cross-reference the fiction with evidence they had found in the primary historical sources. They absolutely loved trying to pull historical sources to pieces: ‘Is it reliable, though?’ was definitely a favourite phrase.
Dividing the learning into three short lessons was worthwhile; it enabled the children not only to take their time with their writing, but also to decide upon what information they wanted to include. On reflection, I should have let the children choose their own working partners. Perhaps someone would have liked to work on his/her own, or in a same-sex partnership. However, as this topic was done near the beginning of the year, it did break down gender barriers in the class.
Finally, letting the children explore a range of evidence in a variety of ways - visual, auditory and kinaesthetic – also proved to be beneficial.",976,162,240,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"of evidence in a variety of ways - visual, auditory and kinaesthetic – also proved to be beneficial. Some children found the trip to the air raid shelter most helpful, others the visit from a grandparent, and yet others preferred watching the Goodnight Mister Tom video extracts or reading books. My structured approach worked – what was great was that no child ever said: ‘I don’t know what to write’, and their short diary accounts spoke for themselves.

EMERGENCY? WHAT EMERGENCY? Ireland has come through many
emergencies. We are now living in the emergency caused by Covid-19, and the most recent one before this one was the bank crash of 2008/9. But for Irish people of an older generation there was only ever one emergency, the one they call “The Emergency”. In the rest of the world, this was known as World War II.
When Britain declared it was at war with Hitler’s Germany on 3 September 1939, the Irish government led by Éamon de Valera quickly declared that it would remain neutral.
Times soon became hard – and they had not been easy in the 20s and 30s. We depended on Britain for a vast range of commodities, including coal, petrol, tea, flour and sugar. Cars and spare parts, tyres, electric light bulbs and all sorts of building materials all came from our large next-door neighbour which now wanted all these things for itself.",987,179,242,1097,False

Shortages
The man entrusted by de Valera to sort all this out was future Taoiseach Séan Lemass who was appointed Minister for Supply. The absence of coal was a big hardship, but Ireland had its own secret weapon – the bogs.

Turf was harvested at a frantic rate. The main avenue of the Phoenix Park was eventually flanked on both sides by ton upon ton of turf destined for the fires of the people of Dublin. The avenue was soon christened The New Bog Road.
Some citizens bought plots of bog in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and spent their weekends cutting and stacking the brown sods.

With petrol in such short supply, its use by private motorists was soon curtailed. It was rationed at first, but as the war dragged on, only members of certain professions such as doctors were permitted to drive their own cars when treating patients. One oft-repeated yarn from the Emergency days told of the ten prominent Dublin doctors whose cars were found by a garda, parked outside Portmarnock golf club. Challenged, they all gave the name of the same local woman they were allegedly treating. The authorities threatened that if they ever did this again, not only would they lose their petrol allowance, but their cars would be confiscated.
Essential tradesmen also got supplied with limited amounts of petrol. Public transport was cut back and as the war – the Emergency – continued the hours of service became less and less. The departure time for the last buses in Dublin was 10 pm.",908,154,244,1097,False

The severe shortage of coal was badly felt, no more so than by the thousands of customers of the Dublin and Alliance Consumers Gas Company. Gas cookers could only be used during certain hours, roughly coinciding with breakfast, dinner and tea (the running order for those meals back then). In between those times the gas company had to maintain a very low flow of gas in the pipes for safety reasons. You were not allowed to use this “glimmer” of gas (and anyway you’d be waiting forever for a kettle to boil.)

Hence the arrival of that fearsome figure who still haunts Dublin folklore - the Glimmer Man.

The Glimmer Man had extraordinary powers: he could legally enter your house and check for recent illegal usage of gas by placing his hands on the cooker ring. Guilty parties could have their supply cut off forthwith.
Lord Haw Haw
Another name prominent in those fraught times was Lord Haw Haw. The nickname was given to him by an English newspaper columnist. The real man behind the name was William Joyce. 
Born in America, but growing up in Salthill, Galway, he was reputed to have been a British agent who helped the Black and Tans. He later joined Oswald Mosley’s fascists before going to Germany.

Ration books
Ration books were issued to all households in 1942. Clothing, tea and other foods were subject to severe limits per person. A parody song included the chorus:
Bless de Valera and Séan McEntee
They gave us black bread and a half ounce of tea.
(McEntee was Minister for Local Government and Public Health).
There was illness and disease then too.",816,130,247,1097,False

There was illness and disease then too. Severe shortages of bread left poor families in dire straits and small children who suffered from malnutrition became ill with rickets, a disorder caused by lack of Vitamin D, calcium or phosphate. There were also outbreaks of typhus – and TB – tuberculosis which ravaged the country well into the 1950s.
Smuggling across the Border was rife. While the south had plenty of butter, eggs and other farm produce, the situation in Northern Ireland was very different. Both sides had rationing of food and clothing, but tea, flour and petrol, which were severely rationed in the south were much more available north of the Border.

Lemass hired an American ship, bought a large quantity of tea from the Calcutta merchants and brought it back to Ireland via a circuitous route.
Northern folk of all persuasions who could afford to do so would come to Dublin for weekends to enjoy the relatively more plentiful food and a normal nightlife that was no longer available in Belfast and other towns.

A dearth of news
The news was heavily censored during the Emergency. The newspapers had to submit their page proofs in advance every night to the Controller of Censorship who vetted them scrupulously for any words or photographs that might be deemed a breach of our neutrality. An Irish Times journalist, Tony Gray, wrote a book about the Emergency entitled “The Lost Years” which recounted, among many other stories, the battle of wits between that paper’s editor R.M.Smyllie and the censors who were answerable to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, Frank Aiken.",872,145,250,1097,False

Smyllie did his best to slip pro-British news into the paper; Aiken, though certainly not pro-Nazi, loathed the British (he had participated in the war of independence – and some of his activities remain controversial).
On the night before VE Day on 8 May 1945 (celebrating victory in Europe) the censors were still busy, but they gave a clean bill of health to the advanced front page proof from the Irish Times. However, when the later city edition appeared next morning, all the single-column pictures of the Allied generals and other commanders had been re-arranged by Smyllie – they now formed a huge V for victory that ran across all eight columns.

During the early hours of Saturday, May 31st, 1941, Mary Tarrant awoke to a loud thumping of Bofors anti-aircraft guns firing into the sky. The 32-year-old daughter of a prominent, Dublin-based livestock merchant got up and went to her stepmother's room.
“Well sure there’s an awful lot of banging going on and noise,” she said excitedly. Her stepmother, who was concerned for the safety of Mary’s brother, who had gone out that night, replied, “I think we’ll go down and make a cup of tea.",949,159,254,1097,False

Irish air observers had earlier detected significant numbers of Luftwaffe aircraft in the skies over Dublin; these aircraft were not in formation and appeared to be circling erratically over the city. Searchlights were switched on to track the intruders and a series of flares were fired – tricolour flares to indicate to the German crews that they had entered Irish sovereign airspace, followed by red flares to signal to depart immediately or be fired upon. These signals went unheeded and the anti-aircraft batteries around Dublin Bay opened fire.

Although there was no loss of life, 21 people were seriously injured and there was considerable property damage.

According to Irish Army Col Edward Flynn, a second cousin of Frank Aiken, then minister for co-ordination of defensive measures, the notorious Nazi propagandist William Joyce, known as Lord Haw-Haw, had broadcast one of his famous ""pre-warnings"" that Amiens Street Station would be bombed in the preceding weeks. Joyce had delivered similar warnings in advance of the Blitz on Belfast and as a prelude to a bomb attack on Dundalk on July 4th.

The worst damage from the blast was visited on the neighbourhood between Newcomen Bridge and Seville Place, where Mary and her stepmother were thrown to the ground by the shockwave.
“They came right over Dublin so they were straight over our house. All our windows and our doors, our front doors, were blown open,” Mary recalled, in an interview with the Imperial War Museum. “The ambulance people came around to see if we were alright . . . the bombs, you know, they sprayed out the cobble stones and the tram lines and that.

Irish neutrality during World War II
The policy of neutrality was adopted by Ireland's Oireachtas at the instigation of the Taoiseach
Éamon de Valera upon the outbreak of World War II in Europe. It was maintained throughout the conflict, in spite of several German air raids by aircraft that missed their intended British targets, and attacks on Ireland's shipping fleet by Allies and Axis alike. Possibilities of both German and British invasions were discussed in Dáil Éireann. Both eventualities were prepared for, although the

Pursuing a policy of neutrality required maintaining a balance between the strict observance of nonalignment and the taking of practical steps to repel or discourage an invasion from either of the two warring parties.
Despite the official position of neutrality, there were many unpublicised contraventions of this, such as permitting the use of the Donegal Corridor by Allied military aircraft, and extensive co-operation between Allied and Irish intelligence. The Irish supplied the Allies with detailed weather reports for the Atlantic Ocean, including a weather report from the lighthouse at Blacksod Bay, County Mayo, which prompted the decision to go ahead with the Normandy landings.[1]

Ireland was in 1939 nominally a Dominion of the British Empire and a member of the Commonwealth. The nation had gained de facto independence from Britain after the Irish War of Independence, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a ""sovereign, independent, democratic state"". A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster 1931 meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions. Thus, in 1939 the Irish Free State had the option of remaining neutral.[2] Relations between Ireland and Britain had been strained for many years; until 1938, for example, the two states had engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War.[3]
Nevertheless, Ireland did not sever its vestigial connection with the Crown and it was not until The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 that the final nominal link was severed.",900,148,269,1097,False

No representatives of the new state attended Commonwealth conferences or participated in its affairs, but Ireland remained a legal member until the British Ireland Act 1949, which accepted the declaration of a Republic and formally terminated its membership in the Commonwealth.
Alongside George VI's few remaining powers, the 1937 Constitution had provided that the holder of the new office of President of Ireland was in ""Supreme Command"" of the Defence Forces.[4]
Internal affairs
Irish neutrality was supported by the population of Ireland.[5] Irish citizens could serve in the British armed forces. At least 50,000 fought in the British Army. Others served in the Merchant Navy and Royal Air Force, some rising up the ranks rapidly, such as the youngest wing commander fighter ace in the RAF's history, Brendan Finucane.",926,148,270,1097,False

A total of 4,983 members of the Defence Forces deserted to fight with the British and Allied armed forces. After the war they faced discrimination, lost their rights to pensions, and were barred from holding government jobs. They were finally formally pardoned by the Irish Government in 2013.[6]
Travel passes and identity cards were also issued to 245,000 people to enable them to travel to Britain to work.[7] Elements of the Irish Republican movement sided with the Third Reich at the

In response to accusations that the state had failed to take up the moral fight against Nazism, the
Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Joe Walshe, said in 1941 that:[8]
… small nations like Ireland do not and cannot assume a role as defenders of just causes except [their] own. ... Existence of our own people comes before all other considerations … no government has the right to court certain destruction for its people; they have to take the only chance of survival and stay out.
On 1 September 1939, in response to the German invasion of Poland, a hastily convened Dáil declared an immediate state of emergency. The day's debate culminated in the Emergency Powers Act, which came into effect one day later, on 3 September.

With such sweeping executive powers, de Valera's cabinet set out to tackle any problems that might arise and curb any inconsistencies with the nation's policy of neutrality.",770,130,273,1097,False

Censorship of radio newscasts meant newsreaders were confined to reading, without comment, the dispatches of each side, while weather forecasts were halted to preclude the inadvertent assistance of planes or ships involved in the war. Public expressions of opinion appearing to favour one side or the other were usually repressed. The word ""war"" itself was avoided, with the Government referring to the situation in Europe from 1939 to 1945 as ""The Emergency"".
However, on the British declaration of war, the teenaged George Cole watched as an effigy of Neville Chamberlain was publicly burnt in Dublin without any interference by the police. Cole sensed that there was:[10]

President Douglas Hyde was a member of the Church of Ireland, most of whose members were exunionists and pro-British. When he was invited to a 1943 wedding to be attended by many of the former Protestant Ascendancy, his secretary received assurances from the bride that there would be no ""pro-belligerent demonstration either by toasting the King of England and/or the singing of the British National Anthem"".[12]

O'Duffy's Irish Brigade fought with the (Fascist) Nationalists and the Irish contingent of the International Brigades fought with the Republicans, though neither had government support.

There were fears that the United Kingdom, eager to secure Irish ports for their air and naval forces, might use the attacks as a pretext for an invasion of Ireland and a forcible seizure of the assets in question. Furthermore, the possibility that the IRA (in line with the Irish republican tradition of courting allies in Europe) might link up with German agents, thereby compromising Irish non-involvement, was considered.[16]

Active republicans were interned at the Curragh or given prison sentences: six men were hanged under newly legislated acts of treason and three more died on hunger strike.[18] The Germans also later came to realise they had overestimated the abilities of the IRA. By 1943, the IRA had all but ceased to exist. In Ireland, neutrality was popular, despite rationing and economic pressure.[19]

In his Saint Patrick's Day address in 1940, Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, lamented:
""No country had ever been more effectively blockaded because of the activities of belligerents and our lack of ships, most of which had been sunk, which virtually cut all links with our normal sources of supply.""[25]

Allied convoys often could not stop to pick up survivors.[27][28] Irish mariners would rescue seafarers from both sides, but they were attacked by both, predominantly by the Axis powers. With the work of the seaman the imports reached their destination and exports, mainly food supplies for Great Britain, were delivered. 521 lives were saved.[29]

As in the days preceding, news of the dumping was widely published, the magazine and the locals who spotted the unloading of the captured Greeks noted that the U-boat had conducted the action and re-submerged before coastal defence aircraft could be directed onto the trespassing vessel.[31][32]

An independent Ireland would see its own independence in jeopardy the moment it saw the independence of Britain seriously threatened.

Ireland is quite ready by treaty to ensure England's safety against the danger of foreign powers seeking to use Ireland as a basis of attack against her.
After the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936, de Valera said at the League of Nations:[34]
peace is dependent upon the will of the great States.

The desire of the Irish people and the desire of the Irish Government is to keep our nation out of war. The aim of Government policy is to maintain and to preserve our neutrality in the event of war. The best way and the only way to secure our aim is to put ourselves in the best position possible to defend ourselves so that no one can hope to attack us or violate our territory with impunity.

Offer to end the partition of Ireland in 1940
At a series of meetings in 17–26 June 1940, during and after the Battle of France, British envoy Malcolm MacDonald brought a proposal to end the partition of Ireland and offered a solemn undertaking to accept ""the principle of a United Ireland"" if the independent Irish state would abandon its neutrality and immediately join the war against Germany and Italy. However, the reality of unity would have to be agreed by the ""representatives of the government of Éire and the government of Northern Ireland"", each of which distrusted the other intensely. De Valera therefore rejected the amended proposals on 4 July, worried that there was ""no guarantee that in the end we would have a united Ireland"" and that it ""would commit us definitely to an immediate abandonment of our neutrality"".",933,160,285,1097,False

The Irish Prime Minister interpreted that statement as an offer to end of partition in return for his nation's entry into the war. De Valera was said to have stated: ""We cannot believe you."" Later stating, ""If we were foolish enough to accept that invitation ... we would be cheated in the end.""[38] De Valera had campaigned against partition and the 1937 Constitution drafted by him had an irredentist clause describing the State as the ""whole island of Ireland"".

In April 1941, the question of Ireland's entry into the war was again raised when the Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies paid a visit to Belfast and Dublin for private discussions with De Valera and John M. Andrews, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Subsequently, Menzies reported to Churchill that the complexity of the questions of Irish unity and sovereignty meant that there was little possibility of Ireland's abandoning its policy of neutrality.[39]

Ireland, like other neutrals was ""...neutral for the power that potentially threatened them most.""[40] During the war, and accusing de Valera as a ""Nazi sympathiser"", the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Craigavon, urged Churchill to use Scottish and Welsh troops to overrun ""southern Ireland"" before installing a Governor-General for the whole island at Dublin, but this proposal was rejected by London. Nevertheless, Churchill directed Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery to prepare plans to seize Cork and Queenstown (Cobh) so

In this regard Viscount Cranborne acknowledged at the war's end that the Irish Government had ""been willing to accord us any facilities which would not be regarded as overtly prejudicing their attitude to neutrality"", collaborating with the British war cabinet.[43] (See below for complete text.) The pattern of cooperation between British and Irish agencies began upon the onset of war when de Valera permitted the use of specified Irish airspace mainly for patrolling coastal points.

Collins, ""more friendly than strict neutrality should have allowed.""[45] The co-operation that emerged allowed for meetings to take place to consider events after German troops had overrun neutral Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. Three days after the fall of France, Irish and British defence officials met to discuss how British troops could, strictly at de Valera's invitation, occupy Ireland upon the event of a German landing there to expel foreign troops attempting to use her as a back door to later invade Britain (Plan ""W"").

Hempel might well have known better of Irish intentions, having earlier described a native custom ""to say agreeable things without meaning everything that is said.""[45]
Other examples of Irish attitudes towards Nazi Germany found expression in mid-1940 in de Valera's Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin, William Warnock, 'whose ""unquestionable"" hostility to Britain could easily be interpreted as sympathetic for National Socialism.'[46] Academic J.J. Lee questioned just how much of Warnock's zeal towards Hitler's Reichstag speech on 19 July was genuine enthusiasm for the 'international justice' that could be expected after Germany's victory, as opposed to an adherence to the instructions of Dublin to please oneself to the potential victors.",842,125,292,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"as opposed to an adherence to the instructions of Dublin to please oneself to the potential victors. Three years later, by 1944, the orientation of the war and of Irish relations to Germany had turned about-face, with the likelihood of a German victory now remote. In that climate, the Irish Government, once so ready to ""say agreeable things"", Hempel remarked, had become ""unhelpful and evasive"".[47]
The United States Ambassador to Ireland, David Gray, stated that he once asked de Valera what he would do if German paratroopers ""liberated Derry"". According to Gray, de Valera was silent for a time and then replied, ""I don't know"".[48]
Condolences on Hitler's death

The Taoiseach Éamon de Valera personally visited Ambassador Hempel at his home in Dún Laoghaire on 2 May 1945 to express official condolences on the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler, following the usual protocol on the death of a Head of State of a state with a legation in Ireland. President Hyde visited Hempel separately on 3 May.[49] Irish envoys in other nations did likewise, but no other Western European democracies followed Ireland's example.[50] The visits caused a storm of protest in the United States.[51]
De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as ""anti-national propaganda""; according to Paul Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the assumptions underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis, and the idea that the Irish were the most persecuted people in Europe.",983,157,294,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ween the Allies and the Axis, and the idea that the Irish were the most persecuted people in Europe.[52]
Position on Jewish refugees
Ireland's position on Jewish refugees fleeing Europe was one of scepticism. Irish authorities during the war generally gave two justifications for turning away prospective immigrants: that they would overcrowd the nation and take Irish jobs, and that a substantial increase in the Jewish population might give rise to an antisemitic problem.[53] There was some domestic anti-Jewish sentiment during World War II, most notably expressed in a notorious speech to the Dáil in 1943, when newly elected independent TD Oliver J. Flanagan advocated ""routing the Jews out of the country"".[54][55]
There was some official indifference from the political establishment to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust during and after the war.",856,133,295,1097,False

This indifference would later be described by Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell as being ""antipathetic, hostile and unfeeling"".[56] Dr. Mervyn O'Driscoll of University College Cork reported on the unofficial and official barriers that prevented Jews from finding refuge in Ireland:
Although overt anti-Semitism was not typical, the Southern Irish were indifferent to the Nazi persecution of the Jews and those fleeing the [T]hird Reich. … A successful applicant in 1938 was typically wealthy, middle-aged or elderly, single from Austria, Roman Catholic and desiring to retire in peace to Ireland and not engage in employment. Only a few Viennese bankers and industrialists met the strict criterion of being Catholic, although possibly of Jewish descent, capable of supporting themselves comfortably without involvement in the economic life of the country.",985,148,296,1097,False

Media
Irish neutrality was used by German propaganda to film an anti-British themed movie in 1941 named My Life for Ireland, which tells the story of an Irish nationalist family in their struggle against the British.[58]
Victory in Europe Day
In his speech celebrating the Allied victory in Europe (13 May 1945) Winston Churchill remarked that he had demonstrated restraint towards Ireland because
""we never laid a violent hand upon them, which at times would have been quite easy and quite natural.""
Britain had occupied neutral Iceland in May 1940. In a response a few days later, de Valera acknowledged that Churchill did not add ""another horrid chapter to the already bloodstained record"" of British–Irish relations, but asked:[59][60]

I would like to put a hypothetical question—it is a question I have put to many Englishmen since the last war. Suppose Germany had won the war, had invaded and occupied England, and that after a long lapse of time and many bitter struggles, she was finally brought to acquiesce in admitting England's right to freedom, and let England go, but not the whole of England, all but, let us say, the six southern counties.

Let us suppose further, that after all this had happened, Germany was engaged in a great war in which she could show that she was on the side of freedom of a number of small nations, would Mr. Churchill as an Englishman who believed that his own nation had as good a right to freedom as any other, not freedom for a part merely, but freedom for the whole-would he, whilst Germany still maintained the partition of his country and occupied six counties of it, would he lead this partitioned England to join with Germany in a crusade? I do not think Mr. Churchill would.

The implications on Victory in Europe Day and after, of having not been involved in the war and having suffered the devastation that defined the course of Europe afterwards, is the subject of historical debate. The devastation shared by most of Europe, and Ireland's avoidance of it, was described by F. S. L. Lyons as:
The tensions – and the liberations – of war, the shared experience, the comradeship in suffering, the new thinking about the future, all these things had passed her by. It was as if an entire people had been condemned to live in Plato's cave, with their backs to the fire of life and deriving their only knowledge of what went on outside from the flickering shadows thrown on the wall before their eyes by the men and women who passed to and fro behind them. When after six years they emerged, from the cave into the light of day, it was a new and vastly different world.",991,180,300,1097,False

In response to that, Ronan Fanning wrote: ""One might question ... the liberating value of war for a people who has so recently emerged from revolution followed by a civil war and in whose midst the
IRA still propounded the creed of violence"".[62]
The Cranborne Memorandum
On 21 February 1945 Viscount Cranborne, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, presented a memorandum to the British War Cabinet regarding Irish–British collaboration during 1939–1945:[43]
They agreed to our use of Lough Foyle for naval and air purposes.

They have arranged for the immediate transmission to the United Kingdom Representative's Office in Dublin of reports of submarine activity received from their coast watching service.
They arranged for the broadening of reports by their Air observation Corps of aircraft sighted over or approaching Southern Irish territory. (This does not include our aircraft using the corridor referred to in (b) above.)

By March 1955, the Minister for External Affairs, Liam Cosgrave, announced that: ""Ireland's application for membership of the U.N.O. still stands although it remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council"". For reasons of diplomacy the government would not state the reason for the objection, nor which country had made it.

Belfast during World War II: helping students to assess historical significance 
Exploring the case study Belfast during World War II involves consideration of how Belfast was affected by the „blitz‟ of 1941. Beyond this, however, it requires an examination of the context in which the attacks occurred as well as the wide range of ways in which life in Belfast was affected by the arrival of war.",916,155,320,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"urred as well as the wide range of ways in which life in Belfast was affected by the arrival of war. Students are concerned, therefore, not merely with what happened but also with why it happened, and what its historical significance is. In exploring issues of causation and significance with students, we have a great opportunity to develop their ability to think critically, which is one of the stated objectives of the syllabus, and an increasingly cherished aim of senior cycle education. 
At previous history in-service sessions, it has been argued that some of the best ways in which students‟ critical thinking can be developed include: 
the use of the enquiry-focused approach 
the use of „critical skills‟ exercises that involve group discussion and judgementforming 
Both approaches are drawn on in the following exploration of the case study.",853,137,321,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"n and judgementforming 
Both approaches are drawn on in the following exploration of the case study. 
The enquiry-focused approach 
The enquiry-focused approach involves organising a set of lessons around an enquiry question on which the teaching and learning activities are focused. It aims to give a clear focus to a series of lessons, to clarify for all concerned what the learning purposes are and to ensure that the sequence of lessons is leading to improved understanding on the part of the students. 
In her book, The Twentieth Century World (The Historical Association, 1997), Christine Counsell outlines the rationale behind the approach. The following is an edited extract: 
Choosing a sequence of interesting historical enquiries gives a clear focus to any scheme of work. This approach has a number of advantages: 
It prevents a superficial run through the content and leads pupils into deeper levels of historical understanding. 
It allows students to engage in real historical debate.",998,156,322,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"deeper levels of historical understanding. 
It allows students to engage in real historical debate. Historians usually begin with a question. 
It motivates students by giving a clear focus to their work. Identifying key questions is a powerful way of „sharing clarity with learners‟. Teachers are thus reinforcing that the whole point of a sequence of lessons or activities is to build towards some attempt at answering the question. Some teachers who use this approach will refer to such a question in every single lesson. Pupils are constantly reminded of what they are trying to do and why. 
Key questions can shape and limit an otherwise sprawling content. 
It encourages pupils to produce more substantial and significant outcomes at the end of a section of work.

To assist students in considering the historical significance of particular events and developments, the following criteria may be useful:

It will be helpful in the course of the enquiry – or at its conclusion – to consider which of the factors in the box above seem most applicable to the experience of Belfast in World War II. 
Belfast during World War II: an overview 
Due to its position within the United Kingdom, Belfast was involved in World War II from the outset. On 4th September, James Craig, the Northern Ireland premier, stated in the Commons that there would be “no slackening in [Northern Ireland‟s] loyalty” and he promised to place all of its resources at Britain‟s command. Belfast had a number of important industries (e.g.",942,164,325,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"place all of its resources at Britain‟s command. Belfast had a number of important industries (e.g. munitions, aircraft, shipbuilding) which had the potential to contribute significantly to the British war effort. As was the case elsewhere in the U.K., the outbreak of war saw the introduction of wartime measures such as rationing, the use of identity cards, censorship and travel restrictions. 
However, in contrast with other major cities of the U.K., life continued much as before in the early stages of the war. There was no conscription, no substantial shortages of food, no significant rise in employment and no bombing. A degree of apathy was evident in the low army recruitment figures and lack of commitment to civil defence measures. Under the leadership of James Craig, the Stormont leadership came to be seen as complacent and ineffective - even by senior civil servants such as Wilfred Spender. Relations with the London government were somewhat strained.",969,155,326,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"civil servants such as Wilfred Spender. Relations with the London government were somewhat strained. 
One positive move towards a more proactive approach was the creation of a new Ministry of Public Security in June 1940, with John MacDermott as minister. However, when Craig died in November, he was succeeded by his most experienced minister, John Andrews, who retained his predecessor‟s cabinet and showed little appreciation of the need for change. Consequently, Belfast was ill-prepared for the German air-raids that took place in April-May 1941, causing large-scale damage, disruption to everyday living and loss of life. The raids – often referred to as the Belfast „Blitz‟ – caused the deaths of 1,100 people, over 56,000 houses were damaged (53% of the housing stock) and £20 million damage was caused to property. The raids increased the unpopularity of Andrews‟ government and he was eventually forced to resign in April 1943.",937,148,327,1097,False

When Basil Brooke succeeded Andrews in April 1943, Stormont‟s relations with the British government were already improving. The strategic importance of Northern Ireland had increased following the fall of France in 1940 and Belfast became an increasingly significant base for naval vessels engaged in the Battle of the Atlantic. On the trade and industry fronts, Belfast port was used for the import of war materials especially from the US and, despite a slow beginning, production in its industries steadily increased, with the shipyards and aircraft factories winning significant war contracts. Other industries also contributed significantly: one third of the ropes required by the War Office were made at Belfast rope works and 90% of British servicemen‟s shirts were made in Northern Ireland.",899,138,328,1097,False

From 1942 onwards, employment was further boosted by the arrival of US troops in Northern Ireland in the buildup to the Normandy invasions of June 1944. 
The active participation of Northern Ireland in the war effort contrasted with the Irish Free State / Éire which adopted a policy of neutrality. Despite its neutral stance, when Belfast was fire-bombed in May 1941, de Valera‟s government sent firemen and appliances to help in fire-fighting and rescue work. Despite this, their different wartime experiences widened the divide between the two parts of Ireland, while the shared experience of wartime raids and the acknowledgement of Northern Ireland‟s strategic importance to the war effort created new bonds of friendship between the Belfast and London governments.",871,137,329,1097,False

Belfast during World War II: a glossary of terms 
Develop your historical literacy 
ARP (Air Raid Precautions) warden 
Air raid precautions are steps taken to protect a place from attack by aircraft. During World War II, Air Raid Precautions (ARP) wardens had responsibility for ensuring that the government-determined regulations and procedures for protecting against air attack were obeyed. Their duties included ensuring that „blackout‟ orders were obeyed and distributing gas masks. 
Balloon barrage 
Large balloons, tied fast to the ground with metal cables, used as a defence against aircraft attack, especially low-lying aircraft, by damaging the aircraft on collision with the cables; some carried light explosives to assist in destroying the aircraft. 
Battle of the Atlantic 
The conflict arising out of German attacks on shipping in the Atlantic during World War II.",979,148,330,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"tlantic 
The conflict arising out of German attacks on shipping in the Atlantic during World War II. 
The Germans tried to cut off Britain‟s supplies of food and munitions using U-boats (submarines) and warships. Allied shipping travelled together in convoys for protection, sometimes accompanied by warships and using aircraft as defensive cover where possible. 
Belfast Blitz 
The term „blitz‟ is used to describe the dropping of bombs from the air on civilian populations in ways that are sudden, terrifying and destructive of lives and property. In the course of four attacks by the Luftwaffe on the nights of 7-8 April, 15-16 April, 4-5 May and 5-6 May, 1941, lasting ten hours in total. 1,110 people died, over 56,000 houses in the city were damaged (representing 53% of the entire housing stock), approximately 100,000 people were made temporarily homeless and £20 million damage was caused to property.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"lion damage was caused to property. (Source: Brian Barton, Northern Ireland in the Second World War. Ulster Historical Foundation, 1995) 
Blackout regulations 
These were rules that required that people turn off their lights, so as to make it more difficult for enemy aircraft to pick out targets. Blackout regulations were brought in on 1 September, 1939. 
Bombs – incendiary bombs, high explosives 
Bombs are usually dropped from aircraft on enemy targets to destroy life and property. Sometimes this is done because a target is strategically important, in that it is helping the enemy‟s war effort (e.g. munitions factories, shipyards); sometimes it is done to terrorise civilian populations and provoke a demand for peace terms. Bombs are hollow cases filled with some sort of explosive material that will cause damage on impact. 
„Incendiary‟ bombs contain a substance that is highly flammable (i.e catches fire easily) and are designed to burst into flames on hitting their target.",987,155,332,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"y flammable (i.e catches fire easily) and are designed to burst into flames on hitting their target. 
„High explosive‟ bombs are bombs of great power and exceedingly rapid action, usually containing a highly explosive substance such as dynamite or TNT. 
Censorship 
When a country is at war, its government usually takes steps to control the news that is printed or broadcast. News items that might assist the enemy in gathering intelligence (information for military purposes) are „censored‟ i.e. not allowed to be printed or broadcast. From the start of World War II, newspapers and the BBC were heavily censored in Northern Ireland. Weather reports that might assist the enemy were not permitted. 
Civil defence 
The term is used to describe a civilian (non-military) service for the wartime protection of a civilian population against enemy attack. Such services included the Air Raid Precautions service, the auxiliary fire service and the Home Guard.",956,151,333,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"h services included the Air Raid Precautions service, the auxiliary fire service and the Home Guard. 
‘Ditchers’ 
The term is used to describe the many thousands of people who left Belfast (and other cities) in the hours of darkness and walked to the outskirts of the city, where they sheltered in parks, ditches and hedgerows until first light when they felt it safe to return home. 
Evacuees 
These are people persuaded to or required to leave their homes in areas under attack or expected to be under attack. During World War II, many Belfast children were evacuated to the countryside for their own protection. 
Identity cards 
These were cards that people had to carry as proof of identity. National registration was introduced in October, 1939, as part of the preparations for a widespread system of rationing. This included people travelling from across the border to take up employment in Northern Ireland.",914,151,334,1097,False

Luftwaffe offensive 
The „Luftwaffe‟ was the name given to the German air force, re-established in 1936 under 
Hermann Goering in contravention of the terms of the Versailles Treaty, 1919. A „Luftwaffe offensive‟ was an attack on enemy targets by the German air force. 
Munitions firms 
These are companies, such as Short and Harland in Belfast, that manufactured war materials such as weapons and ammunition. 
Rationing 
This involves limiting the amount of food and provisions that people are allowed to purchase in times of shortage. In Northern Ireland, petrol was rationed from late September, 1939. Food rationing began in 1940 and became increasingly severe and extensive.

Belfast during World War II: biographical notes 
John Miller Andrews, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, 1940-1943 
(1871-1956) Appointed Minister of Labour in 1921 in Sir James Craig‟s first cabinet, a position he held for sixteen years. In 1937, he was appointed Minister of Finance, effectively becoming Craig‟s deputy and frequently presiding at cabinet meetings. He was appointed prime minister in succession to Craig. More concerned with political than military matters, he came under increasing pressure on a range of issues e.g.",840,136,339,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ed with political than military matters, he came under increasing pressure on a range of issues e.g. the inefficiencies exposed by the Belfast „Blitz‟, the failure to introduce conscription, failure to prevent strikes in the aircraft industry (the latter earning him a personal rebuke from the British prime minister, Winston Churchill). Matters came to a head in 1943 when a group of backbenchers and junior ministers challenged his leadership. His fate was sealed when these critics were joined in April by Sir Basil Brooke, Minister of Commerce, whose resignation from the cabinet prompted Andrews‟ subsequent resignation from office. He served as a backbench MP until 1954 and died in 1956, the last surviving member of the 1921 cabinet. 
Richard Dawson Bates, Minister of Home Affairs, 1921-1943 Key personality (1876-1949) Solicitor and Northern Ireland cabinet minister. During the 1912-1914 opposition to home rule, he helped to organize the Ulster Covenant and the Ulster Volunteers.",992,153,340,1097,False

He was a member of parliament (MP) in Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1945. As Minister of Home Affairs, he had wide powers over security and local government; in the eyes of many unionists, his working of the 1922 Special Powers Act ensured the survival of the state. His distrust of the nationalist minority influenced the development of policies which minimized their role in local government. 
The outbreak of World War II saw increasing criticism of his department‟s inefficiency and he was blamed by many for the civil defence weaknesses which the Belfast Blitz of 1941 exposed. When Basil Brooke became premier in 1943, Bates was dropped from the cabinet.",928,158,341,1097,False

(1888-1972) Brooke became a Unionist MP at Stormont in 1929 and, in May, was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Finance. In 1933, he was appointed Minister of Agriculture. In the same year he made a speech urging employers „to employ good Protestant lads and lassies‟ only. When war broke out, he was persuaded by Craig not to serve in the military but to remain involved in politics. Partly due to his leadership, the farmers of Northern Ireland exceeded the tillage quota set by Westminster in 1939-40. They were the only farmers in the UK to do so. His achievements stood in contrast to the perceived incompetence of most of the rest of the cabinet. The government‟s record did not improve with the death of Craig.",1000,172,342,1097,False

From May 1943, Brooke‟s government was largely successful in fulfilling its initial priorities: greater dynamism in the war effort, planning for the post-war years and defending the constitution. 
James Craig, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, 1921-1940 Key personality

The Special Powers Acts of 1922, ostensibly a temporary measure, was given permanence. A strong supporter and advocate of local industry, he used the occasion of the negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1938 to bargain for armaments contracts for Belfast industries. By the time war came in 1939, his health was poor. Civil service head, Sir Wilfred Spender, in a private memorandum of August 1938, reported that due to his poor health Craig was unable to do more than one hour‟s work daily.

In 1923 he joined the British Fascisti – an organization with many Irish loyalist members - and in 1924 became a member of a militant splinter group, the National Fascists. Joyce joined the Conservative Party in 1928 but, in 1933, began working for Sir Oswald Mosley‟s British Union of Fascists (BUF), of which he became publicity director in 1934. In February 1937 he was BUF candidate for London county council in Shoreditch, where his party won 14% of the vote. In April 1937 he founded the National Socialist League (which never had more than 50 members).

The entry into the war of the USA in 1941 led to large numbers of American troops being stationed in Belfast (and other parts of Northern Ireland) for the first time in its history.

Belfast‟s second night of terror was even worse than its precursor of three weeks ago, although it is hoped that the casualty roll will not be so heavy as it was on that occasion. The smoke was merciful. The discomfort of it mattered little when it hid so much that was not good to look upon. Large areas of the city were cordoned off and guarded by military. No one passed those cordons; for, with falling masonry, the danger of unexploded bombs and recurring outbreaks of fire, it was as much as life was worth. Whole streets were thus cut off, and hundreds of people who had no work to go to walked miles through the smarting smoke and the grime to see the ruin left by the morning‟s bombardment.

We later learned that ships from all over the UK were collected in various locations for sending on to Normandy when the time came. 
Later that week, I woke to the news that the invasion had started and saw that Belfast Lough had quietly emptied of ships in the night.

The documents-based study is “the primary means of developing [students‟] skills in working with evidence”. (Syllabus, page 5) 
The documents-based question “will test candidates‟ ability to interrogate, correlate and evaluate a particular body of evidence”. (Syllabus, page 15) 
Rationale for card sorts 
In a card sort, cards with text (single words, phrases, sentences) are grouped or ranked according to particular criteria. Card sorts are good in helping students to make connections and form judgements. By having the text on cards, students can move them around, group them and, when necessary, change their minds.",952,142,385,1097,False

The intention of the critical skills exercise on the pages that follow is to illustrate in a practical and active manner the type of critical skills that the documents-based study is designed to develop. Essentially, the purpose of the exercise is to encourage students to THINK by discussing snippets of evidence and making judgements on their import by deciding whether they support or oppose the given proposition. The PLAY element is important and the exercise should be an engaging one for students. The intention is not to come up with answers that are either „right‟ or „wrong‟: much of the value of the exercise is in the process itself. That said, it should be possible to reach consensus in most cases and to clarify misunderstandings – where these arise – in the process.",946,157,386,1097,False

What is involved in the critical skills exercise 
Each group of 4-5 students is given an A4 sheet with the proposition at the top of the page and two columns headed: Agrees and Disagrees. Each group is also given an envelope containing 8 short documentary extracts – each on its own small strip of paper or cardboard – and the task is to discuss with each other the appropriate column in which to place each extract.

With the development of wartime industries an unwonted prosperity reigned. People from Éire came to work in the north but they had to register and obtain permits and the prime minister made it clear that they would not be allowed to remain and become voters ... There was movement in the other direction too: many people, among them unionist working men who had never before had the means or the inclination to do so, went south on holiday to escape from the rigours of wartime conditions.

With Mr de Valera‟s resolute adoption of a policy of neutrality for the south, the geographical situation of Northern Ireland in relation to the sea-lanes connecting Britain with North America at once became exceedingly important. This importance was immeasurably heightened after the fall of France in 1940, when German submarines and aircraft were in a position to range far out into the Atlantic in pursuit of Allied shipping. To combat them naval bases were necessary and Belfast, Londonderry and Larne supplied this vital need. From these ports went out many of the escort vessels used in the early stages of the war to bring in the convoys heading for the Mersey and the Clyde by the only avenue open to them – the northwest approaches where Ulster, as Churchill later wrote, „stood a faithful sentinel‟.

Belfast Blitz
The Belfast Blitz consisted of four German air raids on strategic targets in the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland, in April and May 1941 during World War II, causing high casualties. The first was on the night of 7–8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941, when 200 Luftwaffe bombers attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on London, this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during the Blitz.[1][2]

Unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK. Under the leadership of
Éamon de Valera it had declared its neutrality during the Second World War. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with Axis nations: the German Legation in Dublin remained open throughout the war.[4]
Government
The Government of Northern Ireland lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. James Craig, Lord Craigavon, had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. Richard Dawson Bates was the Home Affairs Minister.",926,149,397,1097,False

Sir Basil Brooke, the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to
Britain.[5]
John Clarke MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the ""Hiram Plan"" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.[6] It was MacDermott who sent a telegram to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:
 John Edmond Warnock, the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, ""I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction"" and ""the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.",938,146,398,1097,False

 Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gordon, Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. Chief Whip), resigned on 13 June 1940,[8] explaining to the Commons that the government was ""quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.""
Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by J. M. Andrews, then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54year-old Sir Basil Brooke on 1 May.[9]

 Harland and Wolff was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world. It had constructed many ships for the White Star Line like RMS Titanic and RMS Olympic and for the Royal Navy, including aircraft carriers such as HMS Formidable and Unicorn; the cruisers, HMS Belfast and Penelope as well as 131 other naval vessels.[10] Up to 35,000 people were employed.
 During the war years, Belfast shipyards built or converted over 3,000 navy vessels, repaired more than 22,000 others and launched over half a million tons of merchant shipping – over 140 merchantmen.[11]
 Short Brothers manufactured aircraft. They are best known for the Sunderland flying boat and the Stirling long-range heavy bomber. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was reequipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 Handley Page Hereford bombers.

 Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, ordnance pieces, aircraft parts and ammunition.
War materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Great Britain, some under the protection of the neutral Irish tricolour. The M.V.

Belfast, the city with the highest population density in the UK at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters.

No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some barrage balloons positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover.

Children
Few children had been successfully evacuated. The ""Hiram Plan"" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the River Clyde in Glasgow or the cities of the northwest of England. On 24 March 1941, John MacDermott, Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so J. M. Andrews poorly protected: ""Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until Prime Minister of recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon.

The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six Heinkel He 111 bombers, from Kampfgruppe 26, flying at 7,000 feet (2,100 m), dropped incendiaries, high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. 13 died, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired.

However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.

It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.""[20]
That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant Shankill area, took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic Falls Road. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.

Mortuary
The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. 255 corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.[21] Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the Milltown and Belfast City Cemeteries.
Nurse Emma Duffin
Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in World War I, contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:
(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands.",944,159,415,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.
Major Seán O'Sullivan
Major Seán O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs ""fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another."" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable.",954,151,416,1097,False

He described some distressing consequences, such as how ""in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.""[22]
In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the Mater Hospital at 2 pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, (Theodore Thomson Flynn, an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor Errol Flynn), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of ""casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc."" O'Sullivan reported: ""There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead – heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc."".",969,161,417,1097,False

Refugees
220,000 people fled from the city. Many ""arrived in Fermanagh having nothing with them only night shirts"". 10,000 ""officially"" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of Dromara saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In Newtownards, Bangor, Larne, Carrickfergus, Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. Major O'Sullivan reported on a:
continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference. Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line.",990,159,418,1097,False

At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.
Moya Woodside[23] noted in her diary: ""Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top.

Newspaper reaction
The Irish Times editorial on 17 April:
Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.",830,142,420,1097,False

Aftermath
Southern reaction
By 6 am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 firemen with 13 fire tenders from Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin, and Dún Laoghaire were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.
Taoiseach Éamon de Valera formally protested to Berlin.[25] He followed up with his ""they are our people"" speech, made in Castlebar, County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941):
In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people – we are one and the same",999,175,421,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people – we are one and the same people – and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...
Frank Aiken, the Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. He gave an interview saying: ""the people of Belfast are Irish people too"".[26]
German response
Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A Luftwaffe pilot gave this description ""We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever Churchill is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as Coventry, Birmingham, Bristol or Glasgow.",951,165,422,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"r material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as Coventry, Birmingham, Bristol or Glasgow."" William Joyce ""Lord Haw-Haw"" announced that ""The Führer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample."" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from Joseph Goebbels were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that Adolf Hitler, in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and Irish American politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war.
Eduard Hempel, the German Minister to Ireland, visited the Irish Ministry for External Affairs to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was ""clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.",905,147,423,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"essed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties."" He stated that ""he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air"".
Recriminations
The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. Tommy Henderson, an Independent Unionist MP in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying ""The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.",979,173,424,1097,False

US journalist Ben Robertson reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.[27] One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years, Brian Barton wrote: ""Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North."" Barton insisted that Belfast was ""too far north"" to use radio guidance.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"s, such as Tony Gray in The Lost Years state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of
Belfast Lough Belfast Lough, would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the IRA in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: ""the Catholic population was much
more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany"", ""...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population."" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the IRA Army Council to support Germany. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance.",890,143,426,1097,False

However on 20 October 1941 the Garda Síochána captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and RAF Sydenham, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent
raids'[28][29]
Firemen return south
After three days, sometime after 6 pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted.",927,150,427,1097,False

In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, an invitation was received by the Dublin Fire Brigade for any survivors of that time to attend a function at Hillsborough Castle and meet Prince Charles. Only four were known still to be alive. One, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time.
Second major raid
There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4–5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1 am, Luftwaffe bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island.",850,142,428,1097,False

Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when ""203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs""[6] were dropped. Over 150 people died in what became known as the 'Fire
Blitz'.
Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45 pm while the Luftwaffe attacked more cautiously Soldiers clearing rubble after the from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was May air raid damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.

Republic to Republic: Ireland’s international sovereignty, 1919-1949 An exhibition of documents from the 
collections of UCD Archives 
By University College Dublin Archives In December 1918 the republican separatists of Sinn Féin secured a resounding success in the United Kingdom general election that followed the end of the First World 
War. The party won 73 of Ireland’s seats at Westminster and established themselves as the dominant voice of nationalist Ireland. Rather than take their seats in the House of Commons, those Sinn Féin representatives who were at liberty assembled in Dublin’s Mansion House on 
21 January 1919 as the first Dáil Éireann. They declared 
Ireland independent, and affirmed the existence of an 
Irish republic.",844,131,441,1097,False

Ireland independent, and affirmed the existence of an 
Irish republic. Following the Irish War of Independence 
(1919-21), 26 of Ireland’s 32 counties became autonomous within the British Empire, in the form of the Irish Free State (Ireland had been partitioned in 1920, and so the six counties of Northern Ireland remained within the UK). 
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s the governments of the new Irish state sought to consolidate its position and build upon the measure of sovereignty obtained in 1922, culminating in the formal declaration of a republic on 18 
April 1949. This exhibition focuses primarily on the BritishIrish relationship to explore how this came about. Cocurated by the Royal Irish Academy’s Documents on Irish Foreign Policy (DIFP) series and UCD Archives, it uses archival material retained in UCD to chart the development of Ireland’s constitutional relations from 1919 to 1949; from republic to republic.",960,150,442,1097,False

‘So clearly and completely is the National Constitution a Republican Constitution that, if no provision had been made in it validating the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, in relation to the National Constitution, that statute would have lapsed, and legislation, even in the tenuous terms of that statute, would have been impossible. I hold that, so long as any prospect remains, of securing national unity on the basis of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, it would have been wrong to invalidate it altogether and thus deprive any Government which might be in office of that method of approach to the solution of the problem of national",1000,162,476,1097,False

Analysis: The story behind Eamon de Valera's response to the declaration of an Irish Republic 75 years ago today
By Stephen Kelly, Liverpool Hope University
During a state visit to Canada in September 1948, Taoiseach John A. Costello confirmed reports that the First-Inter Party government intended to repeal the External Relations Act (1936) and Ireland would be leaving the Commonwealth. In November 1948, the Irish Government passed the Republic of Ireland Act.",986,152,496,1097,False

Costello, Seán MacBride and William Norton were leading figures in the main coalition parties, Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta and Labour. All had been bitter opponents of the External Relations Act which had been passed by the Fianna Fáil government in 1936.
Their principal area of contention was that this act recognised the King as the symbol of cooperation within the Commonwealth and confirmed certain of his functions in external affairs. For

From RTÉ Archives, Minister for External Affairs Seán MacBride TD addressing the nation on April 18th 1949, the day Ireland officially became a Republic
While Éamon De Valera's biographers record that he ""rejoiced as one who saw in the action of the government the ending of a long controversy"", he privately believed that the First Inter-Party Government's decision was not necessary. De Valera argued that Ireland was at this moment a Republic in all but name, at least. ""There is no King of the state either internally or externally"", he wrote at the time, ""our executive authority and power internal and external lies with the government"".
Writing to Costello in early April 1948, De Valera refused an offer from the First Inter-Party government to deliver an address to mark the coming into operation of the Republic of Ireland Act, scheduled for April 18th 1948.",975,161,498,1097,False

His reluctance was based on the premise that he could never participate ˜in any such ventures"" as the Act did not merit a national celebration. He believed that ""complete freedom could not be obtained by the blowing of trumpets and the firing of guns"".
De Valera had strong feelings against celebrating any political or constitutional event short of the full reunification of the whole island as a Republic. At a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, he instructed deputies to oppose the amendment of the Republic of Ireland Act, which
operation"". The very use of the name ""Republic"" agitated de Valera as he felt that the term was sacred and could only be used when the entire island of Ireland was united.

The UK government expressed their bemusement of the First Inter-Party Government's handling of the entire affair. Prime minister Clement Attlee privately wrote that the Republic of Ireland Act would only increase the ""difficulty in arriving at any agreement on the partition question"". Indeed, writing in the 1960s the Earl of Longford (formerly Lord Pakenham), a former leading British Labour MP and co-author of De Valera's semi-official biography in 1970, described the affair as merely ""an unhappy accident of history"".
Significantly, the First Inter-Party Government's decision compelled a reluctant Labour government in Britain to introduce the Ireland Act in May 1949. This counter legislation came as a bitter blow to De Valera.",983,153,500,1097,False

The doctrine of consent, which was enshrined within the Act, reassured Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the United Kingdom and effectively gave Ulster Unionists a veto over Irish unity.
London's wish to introduce the Ireland Act in May 1949 was built on two salient points. The first was in direct response to the Irish government's official declaration of the Republic of Ireland Act the previous April, which resulted in intensive lobbying from Ulster Unionists for the British to make a counter-declaration. The second was due to Dublin's decision not to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in January 1949.",742,118,501,1097,False

From RTÉ Archives, one of a number of recordings made at a Republic Day ceremony in O'Connell Street, Dublin, to mark the occasion of Ireland becoming a republic in 1949
The First Inter-Party Government's decision to reject the offer of joining NATO was based on the premise that any military alliance involving the British,"" who the Irish maintained were responsible for partition"" was entirely ""repugnant and unacceptable"" to the Irish people. De Valera agreed, having publicly announced that Fianna Fáil would only support Ireland's involvement in NATO if Ireland was united. For London, Dublin's refusal to participate in NATO made it impossible for Whitehall to retain a detached attitude on partition, as Ireland's refusal had implications for the wider security question of defending the North Atlantic.",916,143,502,1097,False

De Valera was in London at the time of the declaration and the statement seemed to perturb him immensely. He felt that the Republic of Ireland Act was further evidence of the poisoning effect of partition on Anglo-Irish relations. On the day of its announcement, he delivered a speech at Fleet Street in London. Placing the blame squarely on the UK government, he passionately declared ""you have carved up our country"".
The Republic of Ireland Act effectively saw the passing of the veto on Irish unity from London to the custody of the Ulster Unionists. De Valera believed that the Act was an ""ingenious system"" providing the British with two vetoes on Irish unity; the first through the London parliament, the second through Belfast.",835,138,503,1097,False

From RTÉ Radio 1's DocArchive, what did the declaration of a republic mean for Irishmen and women? (first broadcast 1949)
Writing privately to Attlee, de Valera passionately compared Britain's justification for a partitioned Ireland to that of Hitler's rationale for invading Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Poland. The British maintenance of partition, he wrote, ""undermined the morale"" of Irishmen and women and all Europeans.
Significantly, the introduction of the Ireland Act forced de Valera to acknowledge that his use of propaganda to help end partition had proved futile. Not since the introduction of the Government of Ireland Act in 1920 had partition been so resolutely confirmed. From this moment onwards, arguably as never before, De Valera was forced to concede that the ending of partition was a longterm aspiration rather than a medium-term objective.",977,149,504,1097,False

Unit Overview 
Changing Relations: Northern Ireland and its Neighbours, 1920–49 is a local study, providing the opportunity for students to focus on the changing relationships between the north and south of Ireland and Britain following the partition of Ireland in 1920. Students examine the changing relationships during the peace of the inter-war years, when the Irish Free State sought further independence from Britain, through to the war when Éire declared its neutrality and then on to the changing fortunes in the post Second World War period up to 1949, when Éire becomes a Republic. This option also focuses on the lives of the people of Northern Ireland and Éire as they are confronted with the Second World War and the “Emergency” respectively. It then challenges students to examine the social and economic changes that came about in the aftermath of the Second World War.",986,157,507,1097,False

Developing Language for Learning: Changing Relations: Northern Ireland and its Neighbours, 1920–49 
It is widely recognised that History is a highly literate subject where reading and writing, as well as historical analysis and interpretation of evidence, is required. It is for this reason that some students, in spite of their passion for studying history, become demotivated due to difficulties they may have in accessing the subject.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"Ahead
English rule over Ireland, or parts of Ireland had covered a period spanning almost 800 years. Therefore the change over to an Irish government would be a difficult transition and one that would require careful planning and patience.
Most importantly it would demand unity from the political leaders of the country, whose job it was to implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.
Public and Political Reaction
Many of the ordinary population of Ireland reacted very positively to the treaty, relieved and thankful that the bloodshed of the previous 2 ½ years was finally over.
However, the political leaders of the Free State were far from united. The Treaty had split the political leadership and the IRA itself was split, with well over half of them regarding the Treaty as a betrayal.
Dan Breen said that the Treaty was ‘the negation of everything I ever fought for…I wasn’t going to be compelled to give allegiance to a foreign King.",954,162,516,1097,False

Serious rioting took place early in 1922. There were 138 casualties in Belfast in February. ( ¾ of them were Catholic)
30 people were killed in one night
Catholic families fled to the South across the border.
Collins, regardless of agreements made within the Treaty could not ignore such events and found himself in the ambiguous position of helping the Anti-Treaty IRA in the North while dealing with the growing challenge to his authority from their southern counterparts in the Four Courts.

The death of Michael Collins in 1922 had been significant to this issue in that he was the member of the Free State Govt. that had the biggest personal interest in the Northern situation. The fledgling FS govt. had just survived a civil war and wanted to consolidate its position. Its current territory was more manageable and they “seemed less anxious to acquire the Catholic areas of the north than the Unionists were to retain them and it brought no comparable pressure to bear on the Commission.” (Laffan)

Faced with this MacNeill resigned rather than put his name to this shambles. Cosgrave, the Irish Prime minister decided that it would be better to suppress the report and leave the border unchanged rather than try and sell it to the Irish people. In return for reaching this settlement the FS govt. persuaded the British to waive the £6 ¼ per year paid as an Imperial contribution. This was a bonus but looked extremely bad in the eyes of Northern Nationalists. As Laffan put it “just as had been prepared to abandon Fermanagh & Tyrone in 1916 for the immediate prospect of power in , so had Cosgrave recognised the border in 1925 for the sake of a quiet life and for British financial concessions”

June 1920-1922
In Belfast during July 1921 alone, twenty-six people died and forty were wounded as a result of civil disorder
Causes of the Troubles
The result of prolonged political uncertainty
An economic recession caused unemployment to increase, which deepened sectarian divisions
Tensions also increased due to the activities of M Collins and the anti-Treaty IRA in the North from December 1921 to August 1922.
Collins used every means available to destabilise and overthrow the N.Ireland government

British government to safeguard their security

He decided to expand the security forces under his government’s control
During Spring 1922 the number of Special Constables was drastically increased and from February 1922 they bore the main burden of security work 
A new police force was formed called the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary (RUC) which became operational on 1st June 1922

Attitude of British government
Despite funding the Special Constabulary Ministers in Britain were concerned about the expansion of the Special Constabulary.

The Special Powers Act: April 1922
Rees explains that the unionist leadership under Craig found itself in a very dangerous security situation and so stern measures were considered necessary

This included ‘internment’ (the right to arrest and imprison without trial)
The right to impose the death penalty for certain fire arms and explosive offences, with floggings and imprisonment for others.
Further regulations could be made if required without consulting parliament
Reactions to the Special Powers Act
Aroused great criticism from both the British government and the Free State government
According to Barton, Craig hoped that the Act would satisfy his supporters and therefore would reduce the number of sectarian attacks by Loyalist gangs on Catholic civilians
Craig persuaded Britain that it was a security necessity and so London gave unionists in N Ireland a free hand in security matters

N. Ireland after June 1922: Decline in 
Violence
By early June 1922 the levels of violence in Northern Ireland gradually ended
Partly a result of far-reaching security measures adopted by Craig and his colleagues
The beginning of Civil war in the Free State, which began on 28th June 1922- led to a decline in IRA activity as many IRA activists moved south of the border 
Barton also suggests that morale was low within the ranks of the IRA due to lack of public support and the effect of government action.
Seamus Woods, an IRA officer conceded that the position was hopeless and that the national spirit was ‘practically dead’

Barton explains that the experience of this period confirmed many Catholics in their lasting contempt and hatred of both partition and the northern parliament.
‘They never recognised the State as their own and their sense of alienation was transmitted from one generation to the next’.
Problem 2:Financial problems
Like the Free State government the government in 
N.Ireland was put under immense strain by heavy security costs

‘the abolition of PR and the adoption of new electoral areas were major acts of 
misgovernment and an abuse of their power by the unionist leaders themselves’ Gerrymandered local authority boundaries…became a permanent and infamous 
feature of the North’s electoral 
landscape…among the core grievances which were opposed by the Civil Rights movement forty years later’.

There were no deaths during that day but in the evening, crowds gathered in several areas and some Protestant workers were attacked. Guns were fired and within three days 18 people had been killed in the city, in what the Irish News called ‘a carnival of terrorism’. 
Éamon Phoenix commented: ‘These disturbances, as well as the later ones in

Belfast on the brink in 1920
The summer of 1920 saw a period of intense political violence in the north against a background of a post-war economic slump
Marie Coleman
The traditional narrative of the War of Independence identifies the dates of the conflict as encompassing the period from January 21st, 1919, until the truce of July 11th, 1921. This periodisation does not fit neatly around the chronology of the conflict in the northeast, especially Belfast. Arguably a separate conflict occurred here, contemporaneous with the southern War of Independence.
The northern conflict covered a different time span from mid-1920 to mid-1922, and involved different protagonists on the side of the crown forces, with the Ulster Special Constabulary assuming much of the role of bolstering the Royal Irish Constabulary in the north, as the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries did in the south.",984,155,565,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"g the Royal Irish Constabulary in the north, as the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries did in the south.
Apart from the south Ulster regions of Monaghan and Newry, where IRA units under the respective commands of Eoin O’Duffy and Frank Aiken were active throughout the period, the IRA in the north, and especially around Belfast was inactive and disorganised for most of 1919 and the early parts of 1920. However the cumulative effect of the worsening conflict in the south eventually made an impact on Belfast in the summer of 1920.
Events in Cork which had strong reverberations in the north were the ostensible reasons for the outbreak of the most intense phases of rioting and killing in July and August.
On July 17th, a contingent of the Cork IRA shot dead the divisional commissioner of police for the Munster region, Lieut Col Gerald Bryce Ferguson Smyth, at the Country Club in Cork City.",892,155,566,1097,False

Growing fears
Pearse Lawlor’s study of these events, The Burnings 1920, situates them in the wider context of the growing fears locally that IRA violence was creeping northward, concern at the increasing economic prosperity of the Catholic middle-class, Sinn Féin’s recent overwhelming success in the June 1920 local government elections, and the heightened tensions surrounding the annual July 12th festivities which coincided with Smyth’s death.
The rhetoric employed by unionist leader Sir Edward Carson at the Twelfth ceremonies in Finaghy, on the outskirts of Belfast, was interpreted as being particularly provocative. Citing the example of the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1913, Carson warned that if once again the British government proved unable to defend loyalists they would “take the matter into our own hands” and “reorganise in our own defence”.",957,143,568,1097,False

The unionist-supporting Belfast News-Letter blamed the government’s “feebleness in dealing with” the danger posed by Sinn Féin as motivating Carson to deliver “such a militant speech”.
The most extreme violence resulting from the death of Smyth and the ferment surrounding the marching season took place in Belfast in the second half of July 1920.
When the industrial workforce of Belfast returned to their places of employment on Monday, July 21st (the day of Smyth’s funeral in Banbridge) following the summer holiday period that coincided with July 12th, loyalist mobs based in the smaller of the city’s two shipyards, Workman Clark’s “wee yard”, orchestrated a purge of “disloyal” employees, by which they meant Catholics and socialists, from both Workman Clark and the larger Harland and Wolff yard.",905,143,569,1097,False

Similar intimidation resulting in the expulsion of Catholic employees and trade unionists from both religious background in the Sirocco engineering works, the Mackie and Combe Barber foundries, and various of the city’s linen mills and smaller industrial and commercial enterprises.
Alan Parkinson has estimated that 7,000 workers – Catholics and socialists – were expelled from the shipyards, 20 Catholics were killed and many Catholic businesses destroyed, mainly in the eastern districts of Belfast in the areas surrounding the shipyards.
Provocative rhetoric
While Carson’s provocative rhetoric and the death of Smyth might have been the immediate inspiration for the industrial expulsions, they took place against a backdrop of longer-term economic and political tensions, including the increasing political violence in the south, the seemingly inexorable rise of Sinn Féin, and the potential o",999,147,570,1097,False

The targeting of socialists highlights the reverberation of the Russian revolution, and unionist fears of “Bolshevism” making common cause with Irish republicanism.
Furthermore, by 1920 the post-war industrial downturn, which had a particularly detrimental effect on heavy industry such as ship-building, put greater pressure on the availability of industrial employment in Belfast.

Belfast IRA
One consequence of the violence of mid-1920 was the resurgence of the Belfast IRA, although there appears to have been an inherent tension between the old guard IRA leadership and the so-called “pogrom recruits”. Historians dispute the extent to which the IRA acted as a defender of Catholic communities during these assaults, but are more in agreement that the events of the summer of 1920 motivated the Belfast IRA to greater activity against its “enemies”.
This was due in part, perhaps, to the existence of a new enemy in the shape of the Ulster Special Constabulary. This new force was formed in the latter half of 1920 to deal with the summer’s violence, and was recruited largely from loyalist communities that included a number of ex-servicemen and former Ulster volunteers.",895,150,573,1097,False

The permanent B Specials would develop a particularly notorious reputation for sectarian violence against Catholics that would last till their disbandment in 1970.
The use of the term “pogrom” to describe events in Belfast between 1920 and 1922 remains controversial. It is disputed by Robert Lynch and Alan Parkinson, who see it as defining the systematic murder of larger numbers of a religious minority in a given area, whereas the death toll in Belfast was comparatively smaller and a number of those killed were active in the IRA. Its defenders, including John O’Neill and Kieran Glennon, argue that it describes appropriately what was witnessed and experienced by contemporaries who viewed it as such.
The description of these events as a “pogrom” is associated with Fr John Hassan, a priest attached to St Mary’s in Chapel Lane, Belfast. John O’Neill identifies Hassan as “G.B.",985,157,574,1097,False

Death toll
The events of the summer of 1920 set in train a period of intense political violence in the north influenced by political and military upheaval in the south and the ongoing effects of the post-war economic slump.
The estimated death toll in the two years from mid-1920 to mid-1922 is between 450 and 550, with over 1,000 injured, hundreds of homes and business destroyed in arson attacks and thousands of workers left unemployed as a result of sectarian expulsions.",926,151,575,1097,False

Why did de Valera refuse to attend 1921 treaty negotiations?
On this day 100 years ago, negotiations began in London which led to the turbulent birth of an Irish Free State, a seismic step towards full independence.

His failure to attend the talks in person caused bewilderment in 1921 and a century later his motives are still the subject of speculation and intrigue.
Born in the United States to an Irish mother and a Spanish father, de Valera was one of Ireland's most influential statesmen.
A maths teacher by profession, he fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and rose to prominence shortly afterwards as the rebellion's only surviving commandant.
Nicknamed the Long Fellow, his subsequent political career spanned a remarkable six decades, becoming taoiseach (Irish prime minister) three times and serving 14 years as president of Ireland.
But he is also a divisive figure, and much of the controversy that dogs his legacy stems from the decisions he took - and failed to take - at the time of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty.",910,155,577,1097,False

When the talks opened, de Valera was the leader of Ireland's largest democratically-elected party, Sinn Féin.
Although the British prime minister had met him in London before, and was prepared to do so again, de Valera repeatedly refused to go.
""There were those, at the time, who felt that this was a curious logic because he was their most experienced statesman,"" says historian Prof Diarmaid Ferriter.
He adds that some of de Valera's cabinet colleagues were ""disturbed"" by the decision, including the future Irish leader, WT Cosgrave.

Scapegoats?
Was de Valera trying to avoid being personally blamed if the talks failed, having predicted the British prime minister would not give in to demands for a united Irish Republic?
Many critics have accused de Valera of making scapegoats of his negotiating team for accepting a deal which fell short of republican hopes, while he refused to share any of their burden or risk.
However, Prof Ferriter argues that rather than a self-preservation ploy, de Valera's decision to stay at home was more of a strategic miscalculation, fuelled by his growing egotism.
""De Valera was used to deference. He was at that stage the sole surviving commandant of 1916, he had a particular stature and standing nationally and internationally,"" the historian explains.

De Valera took his position as Ireland's de facto head of state extremely seriously and claimed his distance from London gave him a ""tactical advantage"".
But by dictating strategy from Dublin, he put the Irish delegation at a disadvantage from the start.
'Ulster question'
The delegation was led by two high-profile ministers from de Valera's provisional government - Michael Collins, who was also the IRA's director of intelligence, and Arthur Griffith, who founded Sinn Féin.
They were appointed as ""plenipotentiaries"" and yet were instructed not take any final decisions without their cabinet's permission.

What was in the treaty?
The contentious peace deal created an Irish Free State, but did not reverse Irish partition, promising only a review of the path the existing border had taken.
And instead of a sovereign republic, the treaty granted dominion status, which meant staying in the British Empire and swearing allegiance to its king.
De Valera quickly denounced the deal and would have sacked the plenipotentiaries were it not for pressure from his remaining cabinet.
A month later, the treaty was approved by 64 votes to 57 in Dáil Éireann (the Irish parliament).
De Valera resigned as president and was replaced by Griffith.

De Valera survived the Irish Civil War and outlived many of his pro-treaty opponents.
But even into his final years, the 1921 controversy ""continued to trouble him greatly because he was concerned about the verdict of history"", says Prof Ferriter.
Writing in 1963, an elderly de Valera set out several, sometimes contradictory, reasons defending his decision not to attend the London talks.
Perhaps the most obvious reason was that he saw it as a delaying tactic.
He argued that having to refer British proposals back to Dublin ""added strength to the position of the negotiators"" as it gave them more time to respond when things got difficult.

So what was the deal that de Valera would have settled for?
In his 1963 letter, he explained his vision of ""external association"".
It was a third way between dominion status and an independent republic, under which:
Ireland would be linked to the British Commonwealth, but would not become a member
Ireland would control its domestic affairs, but would be associated with Commonwealth states for ""purposes of common concern"" including defence and war
The king would not be Ireland's head of state, but Ireland would ""recognise His Britannic Majesty as head of the association"".

Fanning adds that when the Dáil debated the deal, it became clear de Valera ""opposed the treaty not because it was a compromise, but because it was not his compromise"".

The Long Fellow played the long game, and by 1932 he was back in power, rewriting Ireland's constitution and using the plenipotentiaries' hard won concessions as a platform to gradually gain greater independence from Britain.
NI 100: 'Londonderry's forgotten week of bloodshed' in 1920

That week in June, he said, was ""a hugely significant but largely forgotten time"". ""The sectarian powder keg that had been sitting there for some eight or nine years had been well and truly lit,"" Dr Grant told BBC News NI.
Much of the violence occurred in the Bishop Street area. The city's electorate had returned a Sinn Féin MP in the 1918 Westminster elections. In January 1920, it elected a majority nationalist council which, in turn, returned a nationalist mayor.

Dr Grant said unionists felt their British identity was under threat.

Judges were often dawn from local solicitors or the Catholic clergy, and justice was dispersed in an even handed fashion.
The campaign against the RIC had led to the withdrawal of the police in many areas, and this created a void which the IRA had to fill.

In many localities, the police had Sinn Fein prisoners handcuffed to security vehicles in order to deter ambushes. The IRA commanders ordered their units to engage in counter-reprisals: for every house burned by the Crown Forces they would burn two Unionist houses in reply.
This led to further escalation in the conflict. During 1921, the authorities were relying more and more on the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries to supplement the RIC. Consequently serious breaches of discipline became commonplace.

Interpretation A
Extract from Paul Canning, British Policy towards Ireland, 1921–1941, published in 1985. Canning is commenting on the Anglo-Irish Treaty.
The Treaty provided that Ireland should have the same constitutional status in the Empire as other Dominions, such as Canada. Members of the Irish Free State Parliament had to swear an oath to the Crown. The Treaty provided for the use of naval bases by Britain to ensure coastal defence. In England the Treaty was welcomed with relief by virtually all shades of opinion. Churchill expressed the hope that “the national unity of Ireland within the British Empire would be attained”. He believed that it was this dream of a united Ireland, and not the threat of continued war, which had motivated the Irish to accept allegiance to the Crown.",895,148,613,1097,False

On 9th July 1921, de Valera and other representatives met British representatives, including the Commander-in-Chief of Ireland , General Macready and Under Secretary Andy Cope. A truce was agreed and was to be fully implemented on 11th July 1921. According to Jonathan Bardon, during those intervening three days the Black and Tans murdered a Justice of the Peace in Cork, the IRA killed two unarmed Catholic Policemen and three unarmed soldiers in Co. Cork and then the conflict abruptly ended.",1000,165,614,1097,False

Robert Kee comments on the timing of the truce, explaining that shortly before this truce the Irish Times had printed an article that read ‘All Ireland streams with Blood’ and then according to Kee ‘quite suddenly and almost unbelievably it was over.’ It was indeed a sudden end to a long and bloody three year conflict, in which both sides had committed terrible atrocities.
Source 1 is a speech made by Lloyd George in the House of Commons on 10th December 1920, commenting on British Policy in . Lloyd George asserts the need for a continuation of British government policy and fully supports the use of ‘all necessary steps to crush those who are using murder and outrage against the forces of the Crown.’ His defiant tone echoes the speech made just two months earlier by Winston Churchill when he stated ‘We are going to break up this murder gang.",954,166,615,1097,False

Less than two weeks previous to this speech on 28 November Tom Barry’s Flying Column was responsible for the killing of 17 Auxiliaries at Kilmichael in Co. Cork. So great was the carnage that Tom Barry had to drill his men up and down the road to strengthen morale. In retaliation on 11th December 1920, the Auxiliaries carried out the destruction of Cork city centre and on New Years Day British soldiers burned down seven houses in Midleton, Co.Cork Reprisals like this now had full government approval for the first time.",822,145,616,1097,False

However in source 1 there is a reference to intermediaries which the government had been in touch with, suggesting that attempts to reach a truce had been made by 10th December 1920 and had proven unsuccessful. FSL Lyons refers to one such incident in December 1920 when the Roman Catholic Bishop of Perth, Dr. P.J. Clune was dispatched to Dublin to sound out the Irish leaders, seeing first M Collins and then Griffith and Mac Neill who were both being held in Mountjoy Jail at the time of his visit. However, discussions broke down as Lloyd George, who was aware of the strength of Unionist / Conservative feeling insisted that the Irish had to give up their weapons before peace could be seriously considered.",910,158,617,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ing insisted that the Irish had to give up their weapons before peace could be seriously considered. However, as FSL Lyons states ‘the very fact that the talks had begun at all made it easier to take up the threads again when opportunity served.’ 
Therefore, despite the overwhelmingly belligerent tone of the speech, it is clear that some consideration had been given by Lloyd George to the possibility of a truce by 10th December.
Lloyd George also refers to Sinn Fein not being ready for a peaceful settlement, based on the maintenance of unity within the United Kingdom and this indicates the rejection of the Government of Ireland Act by Sinn Fein. The Act received the royal assent in December 1920 and was in the view of Lloyd George and his government a possible settlement to the conflict. This Act highlights the desire of the Lloyd George coalition government to find a political settlement and would suggest that Lloyd George was already exploring alternative options by December 1920.",997,168,618,1097,False

Source 2 is a declaration issued by seven Church of England bishops and thirteen leaders of the Protestant churches in England and Scotland on 5th April 1921. It suggests that pressure was growing on Lloyd George by April 1921 and so helps explain why the British government was moving towards the need for a truce, as it highlights the range and depth of pressures on Lloyd George to terminate the conflict. The source condemns the continuation of British government policy and the policy of reprisals supported by the government.

However this source only reflects clerical opposition, but alongside this there was growing opposition within the press in Ireland and abroad and politically there was great condemnation about government policy from opposition parties. Asquith spoke from the opposition benches and stated that ‘Things are being done in Ireland that would disgrace the blackest annals of the lowest despotism in Europe.’ The king had also appealed for reconciliation during his official visit to open the Northern Ireland parliament. He stated ‘I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to forgive and forget, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation.’ Such pressure by April 1921 surely had an impact on a move towards a truce by the government by July 1921, just two months later.",875,144,620,1097,False

Source 3 by Paul Canning certainly makes the timing of the truce easier to understand as it catalogues the nature of the political and military pressures that had developed by July 1921 for both the IRA and the British government. Canning refers to the need for 100,000 additional British troops and the likelihood of further unpopular reprisals and the widening of Martial Law. Meanwhile by July 1921 the IRA was running short of ammunition and manpower, especially after the heavy losses of 25th May 1921 in the failed Customs House attack. The IRA had lost 75 men, which included 5 fatalities and 70 arrested. The IRA was also faced with the threat of improved British intelligence.

Canning states the Truce came at ‘a convenient time for both sides.’ This suggests that rather than ‘an unexpected conclusion.’ both sides recognised the need for such a truce by July 1921 and circumstances on both sides made it more likely to happen at this time.

The Various Options

External Association – This was de Valera’s idea. Ireland would be independent but would be ‘externally associated ’ with Britain. Only de Valera had any clear understanding of what this meant.
Republic – There was those in Sinn Fein who felt that the notion of a Republic could NOT be compromised. By the declaration of 1916 this meant 32 Counties + complete sovereignty → the British were never going to accept this.
The possibility of a split within Sinn Fein and the implementation of partition further complicated the issue.

The War of Independence in 
Ireland
1919-1921
* The Sinn Fein election manifesto and campaigners at the by-elections and at the General Elections had often made a point of stressing that there would be no use of violence to achieve their goal of an independent Republic. However, it seemed as if all attempts at negotiations were proving unsuccessful.
USE OF VIOLENCE TO ACHIEVE GOALS –
THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE BEGINS
By 1919, the Volunteers, now called the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been reorganised and numbered about 100,000 men (Collins estimated 15,000 were actively involved in the war).
21 Jan. 1919 – Killing of 2 Irish constables of the R.I.C. at Soloheadbeg in Co. Tipperary – carried out by Dan Breen and Sean Tracy (2 Volunteers) acting independently – received no orders from Collins.

Kee writes … ‘the terror that was gradually going to over take Ireland had begun’.
When efforts at Paris and New York failed, this route became, in the view of Collins, the ‘only policy now open’.
Collins told the Sinn Fein executive at a meeting just weeks later ‘the sooner fighting is forced and a general state of disorder created throughout the country, the better it will be for the country. Ireland is likely to get more….’
A reign of terror was unleashed in Ireland and Collins orchestrated it with ‘relentless singlemindedness and efficiency…’ (R. Kee)

Robert Kee refers to them as a ‘formidable force against the IRA’.
By late 1920 the situation in Ireland had developed into a brutal guerrilla War between two increasingly vicious bands of armed men- the Tans and the IRA.

Dublin/ Tipperary game and two senior IRA men and one Sinn Fein supporter were killed while in custody in Dublin Castle.

THE NEED FOR A TRUCE- WHY?
The British position
The developments in Ireland, especially the destruction of Cork was causing great embarrassment for the British government, both in England and throughout the world.
The Liberals began to increase pressure on Lloyd George to agree to some sort of compromise
The IRA
The IRA within Dublin was significantly weaker following the arrest of over 120 IRA men by the auxiliaries and crown forces during an IRA attempt to burn down the 18th Century Custom House. 
This was the centre of the British Administration and would have been a great coup for the IRA but instead it did great damage to the IRA organisation and their ability to maintain fighting.
Collins had lost almost all his men in this one incident, as well as a considerable amount of ammunition.",902,154,639,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ns had lost almost all his men in this one incident, as well as a considerable amount of ammunition.
The IRA was still very powerful and active within the countryside and the level of organisation and morale was good, but the nerve centre of IRA activity in Dublin had been greatly damaged.
VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
Richard Killeen writes that ‘the birth of Northern Ireland was accompanied by an orgy of sectarian violence in the years 19201922’. 
The War of Independence spread north, where the IRA attacked police and army as in the south.
Protestant mobs drove Catholic workers from the Belfast shipyards and the IRA retaliated by burning Protestant businesses and big houses in rural Ulster.
The violence continued to escalate.
A TRUCE EMERGES-1921
The two sides were locked in stale mate
9th July 1921- de Valera and other representatives met British representatives, including the Commander-in –chief of Ireland, (General Macready) and Under-secretary (Andy Cope).",975,156,640,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"s, including the Commander-in –chief of Ireland, (General Macready) and Under-secretary (Andy Cope).
11th July 1921- a truce was signed between all the Crown forces and the IRA. 
Robert Kee comments on the speed at which these developments took place, when he writes that shortly before this truce the Irish Times had printed an article that read ‘All Ireland streams with blood.’ Then ‘quite suddenly and almost unbelievably, it was over’.
From Truce to Final Settlement
• A political settlement/ solution which would turn the truce into a lasting peace was to prove much more difficult to achieve

It means that the Private Session might as well not have been held. THE SPEAKER: Share I wish the members to understand that this is not a matter of the Chair's ruling that this document is confidential. It is simply a matter of a request made by the President and communicated by me to the Dáil, through the ordinary courtesy of procedure, as the President's desire.

I will now clear it up by saying that at the time to which reference was made I was engaged in recruiting but it was not for the British Army. THE SPEAKER: Share The following Notice of motion has been received:—Notice of Motion by Eoin Mac Neill, Deputy for the National University of Ireland and for Derry City and County: To move that ""Dáil Eireann affirms that Ireland is a sovereign nation deriving its sovereignty in all respects from the will of the people of Ireland; that all the international relations of Ireland are governed on the part of Ireland by this sovereign status; and that all facilities and accommodations accorded by Ireland to another state or country are s",1000,172,750,1097,False

MR. GAVAN DUFFY: Share Is that an amendment? THE SPEAKER: Share No. MR. MILROY: Share Might I suggest that that be handed to the Deputies? MR. HARRY BOLAND: Share I rise to speak against this Treaty because, in my opinion, it denies a recognition of the Irish nation. I said yesterday, and I repeat here, that this Treaty is not one for the consideration of Dáil Eireann, and not one for approval by Dáil Eireann, but by the Southern Parliament according to Article 18. I object to it on the ground of principle, and my chief objection is because I am asked to surrender the title of Irishman and accept the title of West Briton.",864,155,751,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ection is because I am asked to surrender the title of Irishman and accept the title of West Briton. I object because this Treaty denies the sovereignty of the Irish nation, and I stand by the principles I have always held— that the Irish people are by right a free people. I object to this Treaty because it is the very negation of all that for which we have fought. It is the first time in the history of our country that a body of representative Irishmen has ever suggested that the sovereignty of this nation should be signed away. We went before the people of Ireland on a clear-cut, definite issue. We protested against the men who spoke for the Irish people, and we said that if elected— in 1918—we would set up in Dublin, the capital of the Irish nation, a Parliament that we selected for our political ideal, and a Republic; and we said that if elected we would re-affirm the independence of Ireland and seek international recognition for that.",953,173,752,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"elected we would re-affirm the independence of Ireland and seek international recognition for that. When I went before the people of Roscommon I was in earnest when I said that I stood for an Irish Republic. Since I have returned I have received scores of letters from friends and constituents—men urging me in the interests of Ireland and of the people of Roscommon to vote for this Treaty. I had a letter yesterday from a reverend clergyman asking me to cast my vote for this Treaty, and this man gave me great support when I was going through Roscommon seeking the suffrages of the people. On one occasion, at a public meeting, this clergyman said: ""Vote for Harry Boland and the Irish Republic and you will get a good Home Rule Bill."" And I got up immediately after he had finished and had to undo the work of my clerical supporter. He is consistent to-day when he asks me to vote for the Treaty; and I am consistent to-day as I was in Roscommon.",950,174,753,1097,False

We secured a mandate from the Irish people because we put for the first time before the people of Ireland a definite issue; we promised that if elected we would combat the will, and deny the right of England in this country, and after four years of hard work we have succeeded in bringing Ireland to the proud position she occupied on the fifth December last. The fight was made primarily here in Ireland; but I want to say that the fight that was made in Ireland was also reflected throughout the world; and we —because we had a definite object—had the sympathy of liberty-loving people everywhere, if we were denied the support of the Governments.

We were sent out to secure international recognition from the Government of the United States, and to seek the support of the liberty-loving American people on behalf of a nation struggling to be free—and when we left this country Ireland was unknown—and people, liberty-loving peoples, and peoples who are free, had no concern with a domestic question between Great Britain and Ireland. They in America had been under the impression for forty years that Ireland and England were one and that there was a domestic squabble; and we found that the greatest barrier that we had to break down was that Ireland had acquiesced in British law, and all the American people knew was that we were fighting for something called Home Rule.",828,142,755,1097,False

As a result of the magnificent fight put up at home by the men of the army and supported by the people of Ireland, the American people soon realised that we were fighting for our own God-given right to freedom; and if we were not recognised by the Governments of the world we were recognised by the peoples of the world; and as for the Treaty, I can say this: that the power of public opinion—outraged public opinion—throughout the world, backed by the magnificent fight the men and women of this country put up, had brought Ireland to the position that she rightly occupied. We found Ireland in 1918 a domestic question of Great Britain; by the work that has been accomplished since, she is now a burning international question; and no one believes in this House that it is for any altruistic purpose that Great Britan has changed her hand and called the Irish people into conference.",986,176,756,1097,False

Protestants did not have to artificially construct a sense of nationhood, for they had long defined their identity around two antinomies or opposites; the one religious, the other national. Northern Ireland defined itself by its Protestantism against Catholicism and by its Britishness against Irishness; Protestantism and Britishness were its core values and they had been established as symbols of Ulster centuries before. This also meant, however, that anti-Catholicism and anti-Irishness continued as central defining tenets of the new state. However, partition of the island of Ireland solved nothing for Protestants. It may have kept from them a Catholic Ireland, but the old problems were transported with them into the new territory.",966,149,779,1097,False

The same dimensions of differentiation occurred, and around them the same conflicts. The same zero-sum framework was applied to Protestant-Catholic relations in Northern Ireland, by the perpetuation of traditional anti-Catholicism and anti-Irishness, in order to achieve the same ends - protecting die security of Protestants, which simultaneously meant the domination of Catholics. Supporters of partition were aware of this, for they argued at the time that a smaller area with as large a Protestant majority as possible was preferable to the whole of die ancient province of Ulster, with its unsafe Protestant majority (Farrell, 1976: 24).",743,113,780,1097,False

So Unionist leaders deliberately decided, if reluctantly, to jettison Protestants in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal in order to protect their dominance in the six counties and Ulster's religious, economic and national-identity interests (Ruane and Todd, 1996: 50). The historian A.T.Q. Stewart explains that the rationale was the 'simple determination of Protestants in north-east Ulster not to become a minority in a Catholic Ireland' (Stewart, 1977: 162); ensuring they had majority status in the new territory was the main point. The Unionist Belfast Telegraph reassured readers, should they feel guilty, that it was better for two-thirds of passengers to save themselves than for all to drown.

The Catholics who remained in the North felt as abandoned as Protestants in the South. It is forgotten by Unionists in Northern Ireland, who bemoaned the position of Protestants in the South at having to confront, as they portrayed it, a social structure which excluded them and a cultural value system to which they felt outsiders, [1] that this was precisely how Catholics felt in the North at the time of partition. They lacked a separate cultural identity as Northern Catholics, they had no secure national identity, no long local roots in Ulster, nor any political coherence, and they were defined as outsiders by the state's core values of Protestantism and Britishness. They were offered citizenship in the new state but on terms which made their Catholicism and Irishness problematic, and their position in the social structure made them second-class citizens.",969,160,782,1097,False

Accordingly, they mostly withheld legitimacy from the state, adding yet more tensions to Protestant-Catholic relations in Northern Ireland. This made the stakes even higher in the long-standing zero-sum conflict, for the losses and gains for either side now included the very existence of the state. The history of Catholic progress in Northern Ireland, however, shows their transition from a fragmented and subjugated community to a position of growing self-confidence, cultural self-awareness and cohesiveness, and political assertiveness. This may or may not have occurred more rapidly without terrorism, but the sustained period of civil unrest since 1968, known colloquially as 'the troubles', has polarised Protestant-Catholic relations and reinforced the zero-sum framework within which group interests are constructed by both communities in Northern Ireland.",967,136,783,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"-sum framework within which group interests are constructed by both communities in Northern Ireland. The violence has made traditional hatreds worse. Developments in Northern Ireland have also confirmed Protestants in their mind-set. Political domination by Protestants proved to he weak and insecure; the economic base of Ulster similarly so. The re-emergence of terrorism confirmed many Protestants in their opposition to a united Ireland and fed their negative attitudes toward Catholics. Terrorism, in this sense, enabled anti-Catholicism to be disguised by elevating it into an issue of law and order. Violence has also disguised anti-Catholicism by allowing Protestants to claim that they are objects of a process of anti-Protestant ethnic cleansing. The tendency has been reinforced for Protestants to be insular and incestuous, to see themselves as beleaguered and threatened, perpetually insecure and undermined, unable to rely on anyone but themselves.",962,140,784,1097,False

Insecurity has been reinforced by British-In relations as well. From the beginning of Northern Ireland, the Unionists let it known that Britain should let them get on with running the province, and Britain seemed content to let them away with it until the wide-scale unrest provoked in 1 by the demand for Catholic civil rights.",713,112,785,1097,False

We exploit Irish events during the period and structural differences in land bonds to tease out a measure of investors׳ credibility in a UK sovereign guarantee. Using Ireland׳s default on intergovernmental payments in 1932, we find a premium of about 43 basis points associated with uncertainty about the UK government guarantee. We discuss the economic and political forces behind the Irish and UK governments׳ decisions pertaining to the default. Our finding has implications for modern-day proposals to issue jointly-guaranteed sovereign debt.",877,130,828,1097,False

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"h of a nation needs to extend beyond measures of income to include natural capital and biodiversity. Adam Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations – published in 1776 – was an inspirational treatise that set the foundation for modern economic theory. This year, the tercentenary of Smith’s birth, is a timely moment to return to his famous work and consider what the wealth of nations might mean in the 21 st century. While there have been many discussions about Smith over the decades, his core message of the importance of capital for economic development has tended to be sidelined. Many representations of his legacy have highlighted growth in income, but not necessarily growth in wealth. Drawing inspiration from Smith, the 2006 report Where is the Wealth of Nations? was a landmark publication from the World Bank. It attempted to shift the focus away from measuring a nation’s income towards measuring its wealth.",951,159,872,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"It attempted to shift the focus away from measuring a nation’s income towards measuring its wealth. This was followed by updates, entitled Changing Wealth of Nations , in 2011 , 2018 and 2021 . These concentrated on sustainable development, with the 2021 report arguing that focusing on the change in wealth per capita could help to manage risk and uncertainty, especially in the light of climate change. Yet while there is conceptual agreement about the importance of wealth between Smith and modern practitioners, there is a difference in practical application. Smith famously wrote: ‘I have no great faith in political arithmetic, computations’ (book IV, c. v). The World Bank view is more empirical, stressing that ‘how we measure development will drive how we do development’ ( World Bank, 2011 ). This article considers how Smith’s thinking aligns with economists’ approach to the concept of wealth in the 21 st century.",926,150,873,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"how Smith’s thinking aligns with economists’ approach to the concept of wealth in the 21 st century. Capital is wealth and wealth is capital While it may seem obvious that wealth should be at the centre of political and economic discourse, this is not the case. In fact, it is a measure of income – gross domestic product (GDP) – that tends to dominate discussions around the economy. While GDP is related to wealth, it is a return on wealth but not wealth per se . Specifically, GDP is a flow (measured over a period of time), whereas wealth is a stock (accumulated over time). Many continue to confuse stocks and flows (see Hamilton and Hepburn, 2014 ; and Hamilton and Hepburn, 2017 ). Crucially, it is possible to increase our income by running down our wealth ( Dasgupta and Levin, 2023 ). Smith was also keen to emphasise this distinction.",845,151,874,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"ing down our wealth ( Dasgupta and Levin, 2023 ). Smith was also keen to emphasise this distinction. He specified that although money (gold and silver) ‘in common language frequently signifies wealth’, it was not; instead, a nation’s wealth comprised ‘its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds’. For Smith, capital – to which the second book of The Wealth of Nations is dedicated – is the wealth of nations. As he outlines: ‘To maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate consumption is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and circulating capitals. It is this stock which feeds, clothes, and lodges the people. Their riches or poverty depends upon the abundant or sparing supplies which those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate consumption’ (book II, c. i). A key facet of Smith’s analysis was his emphasis on net capital not gross capital.",916,155,875,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"(book II, c. i). A key facet of Smith’s analysis was his emphasis on net capital not gross capital. In this, he meant that the net income of a country – after deducting various expenses involved in maintaining its capital stock – was what people could save ‘or spend upon their subsistence, conveniences, and amusements’. Further that ‘real wealth’ was in proportion to net income not gross income. Again, this is a distinction with convention today. We currently focus on GDP, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced by a country, and not net domestic product, which takes account of the depreciation in the value of fixed assets. This is similar, in principle, to ideas proposed on net income, which look at what the maximum attainable level of consumption is for a society without running down its capital stock, broadly defined ( Weitzman, 1976) .",877,149,876,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"umption is for a society without running down its capital stock, broadly defined ( Weitzman, 1976) . The idea of net income is also what underpins approaches such as ‘green GDP’, which adjust GDP for pollution damages associated with economic activity (see, for example, Muller et al, 2011 ). Among environmental economists, there is a consensus view that wealth is capital. This wealth is defined in broad terms, comprising all capital assets – physical assets, such as cash, property and equipment; human capital – for example, skills, education and knowledge; natural capital, including water, land and organisms; and technology, such as servers ( Dasgupta, 2001 ; and Weitzman, 2003 ). As a result, we have a much broader definition of capital today (see Figure 1).",769,125,877,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"nd Weitzman, 2003 ). As a result, we have a much broader definition of capital today (see Figure 1). The key insight is that a country could see an increase in its income (GDP), but this might not be sustainable because the perceived economic growth might be reducing the country’s wealth and thus its capacity to generate future income ( Dasgupta and Levin, 2023 ). Figure 1: Portfolio of wealth Source: Barbier, 2019 Looking at how the composition of capital has developed over time, research shows how human capital – the skills and knowledge that an individual invests in and acquires – has been one of the most important forms of capital in UK economic history (McLaughlin et al, 2014 and 2017 ). Figure 2: The composition of wealth, 1770-2000 Source: McLaughlin et al, 2014 and 2017 How does Smith’s vision of capital compare with modern interpretations? For Smith, there were three portions of capital with distinct functions: immediate consumption; fixed capital; and circulating capital (boo",1000,166,878,1097,False
option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"capital with distinct functions: immediate consumption; fixed capital; and circulating capital (book II, c. i). Smith’s fixed capital comprised four features: ‘all useful machines and instruments of trade which facilitate and abridge labour’ ‘all those profitable buildings which are the means of procuring a revenue’ the improvement of land ‘the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society’. The first two points here are similar to how we see capital today, as ‘produced assets’, while the third relates to ‘non-produced assets’ ( OECD, 2009 ). But Smith’s view of capital was also broader as he saw human capital as part of the capital stock.

Figure 3: Schema of wealth Source: Fisher, 1906 Here we see some aspects of wealth that were prominent in Smith’s times, but have changed significantly over time, notably slavery. So, while the concepts are similar over time, there are distinct differences. What about natural capital? What’s relevant here is how Smith saw capital accumulating. Capital constantly flowed between the three purposes of capital described above, and it was replenished from three sources: ‘the produce of land, of mines, and of fisheries’. In turn, the productivity of land was determined by how capital was applied to it. Here we can make a comparison to what is known as the Hartwick Rule ( 1977 ), which is one of the key models underpinning the wealth approach.",847,143,880,1097,False

Despite gloomy predictions, the country did not erupt into civil war and Cosgrave gave up power without a fight. de Valera immediately adopted policies designed to cut all ties with the UK. He abolished the ""land annuities"" in 1932 and the Dail's Oath to the King of England in 1933. Also in 1933, he reduced the powers of the British governmental representative in Ireland (and in fact abolished the post in 1937).

The annuties were money that the British government had loaned to Irish farmers before the Government of Ireland Act of 1921 and which the farmers had agreed to repay. Part of the Anglo-Irish treaty was that the Free State government would collect these debts and return the money to Britain. Britain was so furious with the Irish for keeping the money, that they imposed a 20% tariff on trade with the Free State. The Irish found that they could no longer sell their beef to Britain or Northern Ireland and so they retaliated by imposing a tariff in the opposite direction. This prevented Britain selling coal to Ireland. However, Britain did not depend on Ireland as much as Ireland did on Britain, and this seriously crippled the Irish economy. After 5 years, in 1938, the two countries signed an agreement to end the trade war.",932,162,900,1097,False

Under this settlement the Free State give Britian £10,000,000 to pay off the annuities and in return Britian pulled out of her naval bases in Ireland. Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany in 1933 and, since then, British relations with Germany had deteriorated. Therefore pulling out of the naval bases was a hard choice for Britain, considering that war was looking increasingly possible. In 1936, de Valera abolished the King's right to interfere in Free State affairs, although he was still recognised as the Head of Commonwealth. This abolition, imposed via the External Relations Act, coincided with the abdication of King Edward 8th so that Britain did not have time to object to it. In 1937 de Valera introduced a new constitution, replacing the one agreed after the formation of the Free State.",908,154,901,1097,False

The new constitution was put to a referendum and was narrowly accepted by the people. In September 1939, the UK went to war with Germany when it invaded Poland ignoring British and French demands for it not to. Northern Ireland, as part of the UK, found itself at war too.

The return of the naval ports had come just in time, since Eire would have had to oust the British to remain neutral. The Eire government looked with increasing anxiousness as Hitler invaded and took over 8 neutral European countries in 1940, since they knew that the Irish army wouldn't have a hope against the Germans in an invasion. (In fact documents found after the war showed that Hitler had genuine plans to invade Ireland. The operation, called ""Operation Green"", would have provided a springboard for invading mainland Britain through its unprotected west coast. The invasion never happened due to German distractions in the USSR.) Nevertheless, de Valera refused to join the war.

Despite the government's official line, however, the Irish people sympathised with the British and 40,000 Irish joined the British army and over 150,000 worked for the war effort. Nevertheless, the Irish declaration of neutrality brought resentment in Northern Ireland where times had got hard with rationing and blackouts while Eire could still trade freely. In mid 1940, Britain looked to be in an impossible situation. With most of Europe in NAZI hands, and the USA refusing to join the war, they were desperate for any help. In June a British minister, Malcolm MacDonald came to Dublin and more or less offered to give Northern Ireland to Eire in return for military help. He told de Valera that he believed that Stormont would agree to this idea. De Valera, however, was sceptical and did not think that Stormont would be that easy to persuade.",950,160,904,1097,False

He also feared the consequences of a large Unionist population being pushed into Eire against their will. So he refused the offer. In April and May 1941, the Germans began bombing cities in the UK nightly in a tactic known as the 'Blitz'. Stormont was complacent, believing that the Germans would not attack a part of the UK as far away as Northern Ireland, and did not install many air-raid shelters. However they were wrong: in German eyes Northern Ireland was contributing to the war effort and was therefore as much a target as the rest of the UK. On several nights, but mainly on the night of 15-16 April 1941, German bombers pounded both Belfast and Derry with hundreds of tonnes of explosives, killing 900 people, destroying thousands of buildings and making 10,000 people homeless.

Despite Irish neutrality, the fire brigades from Dundalk, Drogheda and Dublin assisted in the Blitz. Many people, united across their politics by fear, fled into the country. Some wealthier people lived in hotels in Eire during the Blitz. Eire did not get off totally scot-free. One set of lost German bombers mistook Cork for Cardiff and bombed it. Dublin was also lightly bombed on a number of occasions. On each occasion, the Eire government swallowed hard and let it pass. Again, Eire viewed its policy of neutrality with some artistic license. For example it permitted British and US planes to overfly county Donegal on their way to bases in Fermanagh and when British airmen crashed in Eire they were quietly escorted to the border, while German pilots were interned. All told, aside from the loss of life and property, the war was good for both Eire and Northern Ireland.",979,166,906,1097,False

Northern Ireland's flagging ship and cloth industries boomed. And a new industry, aircraft manufacture, was set up in Belfast which still exists today. Eire benefitted with many of its citizens employed in the war effort. It also enjoyed trade with Britain for scarce goods that Eire could get as a neutral country, such as butter. The only things to mar the good relations between the two states were (a) de Valera condemning the siting of US bases in Northern Ireland (b) de Valera expressing his condolences to the German ambassador when Hitler died (c) Britain's public, verbal, attack on Eire when the war was over for not joining the 'crusade against fascism'. < Previous History Menu Next >   

This book falls into three parts. The first gives some account of the impact of war upon the Commonwealth and upon its in-dividual member nations; the second records the post-war changes in its composition, while the third examines some of the domestic and external problems that confronted the Commonwealth in the bleak mid-years of the cen-tury. Each of these topics, if treated exhaustively, would require a volume and what is attempted in this book is no more than the analysis of certain themes which seem to bear most closely on the idea of the Commonwealth and its place in the history of our times.",961,155,920,1097,False

De Valera's ruling party, Fianna Fáil , supported his neutral policy for the duration of the war. This period is known in Ireland as The Emergency , owing the title to the wording of the constitutional article employed to suspend normal governance of the country. Pursuing a policy of neutrality required maintaining a balance between the strict observance of non-alignment and the taking of practical steps to repel or discourage an invasion from either of the two warring parties. Despite the official position of neutrality, there were many unpublicised contraventions of this, such as permitting the use of the Donegal Corridor by Allied military aircraft, and extensive co-operation between Allied and Irish intelligence.",946,149,973,1097,False

The nation had gained de facto independence from Britain after the Irish War of Independence , and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a ""sovereign, independent, democratic state"". A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster 1931 meant that unlike in World War I , Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions.

[ 3 ] Nevertheless, Ireland did not sever its vestigial connection with the Crown and it was not until The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 that the final nominal link was severed. No representatives of the new state attended Commonwealth conferences or participated in its affairs, but Ireland remained a legal member until the British Ireland Act 1949 , which accepted the declaration of a Republic and formally terminated its membership in the Commonwealth.

[ citation needed ] In response to accusations that the state had failed to take up the moral fight against Nazism , the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs , Joe Walshe , said in 1941 that: [ 8 ] … small nations like Ireland do not and cannot assume a role as defenders of just causes except [their] own. ...

The key provisions were as follows: [ 9 ] The government may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by order (in this act referred to as an emergency order), such provisions as are, in the opinion of the government, necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, or the preservation of the state, or for the maintenance of public order, or the provision and control of supplies and services to the life of the community.

At the start of World War Two, Belfast had considered itself safe from an aerial attack, as the city’s leaders believed that Belfast was simply too far away for Luftwaffe bombers to reach – assuming that they would have to fly from Nazi Germany. However, the successful Nazi invasion of France in the spring of 1940 ended this belief as Luftwaffe bases in the Cherbourg region of France made a bombing raid on Belfast very possible. Belfast was home to some very important industries that were vital to the war effort. Harland and Wolff shipyards were based in the city. These employed 35,000 people and destroyers, aircraft carriers and mine sweepers were built here. The aircraft manufacturer Short and Harland employed 20,000 people and was also based in Belfast.",867,148,991,1097,False

The city’s dock complex was the last before the journey across the Atlantic and was vital for the landing of American supplies prior to America’s entry to World War Two in December 1941. The first known Luftwaffe reconnaissance flight over Belfast was on November 30 th 1940. Reconnaissance flights had given the Luftwaffe very detailed photographs of what factories were where within the city. They also showed where the 22 anti-aircraft guns were and analysis showed that 16 were heavy AA guns while 6 were classed as light. As a comparison, 100 AA guns defended Liverpool. The Luftwaffe concluded that Belfast “was the most poorly defended city in the UK”. Their conclusion was very accurate.",967,158,992,1097,False

The government of Northern Ireland had long held the view that Belfast was simply too far away for the Luftwaffe to reach. Another belief was that the Luftwaffe would have more important targets on the mainland. The population shared this air of complacency. In the time between the start of the war in September 1939 to the first bombing in April 1941, Belfast had experienced 22 air raid siren alerts – each one a false alert. This cultivated an atmosphere of carelessness among many and this extended to things such as blackouts – strictly enforced on the mainland. “People were careless about their light.” (Jimmy Wilton, Belfast ARP). Only 200 air raid shelters had been built for a population of 500,000. The government in London had to share some of the blame for this as it told politicians in Stormont to concentrate on building air bases as opposed to bomb shelters.",977,168,993,1097,False

The peace in the city was shattered on April 7 th /8 th 1941 when the Luftwaffe launched its first raid on the city – a probing raid to test the city’s defences. The attack became known as ‘The Dockside Raid’. More than 500 Luftwaffe bombers and escorts took off from northern France – many headed for Clydeside and Greenock in Scotland. However, 8 bombers veered off to Belfast on what was an exploratory raid to test the city’s defences. Facing minimal defences, they dropped about 800 incendiary bombs on the dock area. They acted as markers for other bombers to attack. Belfast paid a heavy price for its lack of defences. Traditionally, homes of the workers had been built very near to the factories/docks where individuals worked so that travel and time spent getting to work was kept to a minimum.

The incendiary bombs also set fire to large timber yards. Harland and Wolff dockyards were hit, as was the Rank Flour Mill. Thirteen people were killed in this raid – twelve within the dock area. In what was a probing attack, the Luftwaffe found out what it thought to be true; that Belfast’s defences were “weak and scanty”. The Luftwaffe planned a return raid. Politicians at Stormont called on London for more defences. However, by the time of the ‘Easter Raid’ – just one week later – Belfast had been given just one extra searchlight, one extra anti-aircraft gun and a smokescreen gun. The city defence’s remained in a perilous state. The ‘Easter Raid’ took place on April 15 th /16 th 1941.

The people called it ‘ditching’ – similar to ‘trekking’ in England. Between 150 and 160 Luftwaffe bombers attacked Belfast and dropped around 200 tons of high explosive and incendiary bombs. The city only had sixteen heavy calibre anti-aircraft guns it total and they made little impact. Around 56,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The Luftwaffe first targeted the city’s waterworks. Some thought that the reflection off the reservoir had fooled the pilots into thinking that they were near the docks. In fact, the waterworks had been deliberately targeted. Fire crews found that their hoses were of little use in the inferno because the water pressure was very low.

Like many people the war impacted on her life in many ways and she told me about her experience of Yanks, rationing, smuggling and of an ‘old-fashioned’ evacuee. Influence of the Yanks I attended school from when I was five and a half years old until I was in my teens.

At that same time, however, because of the war the Yanks came to County Fermanagh. That was enough for my father. Whether it was an excuse or not I don’t know, but he wanted me at home to work. I would have to walk half a mile to the bus and he said, ""That's enough, she's not going” and that was that. So that was the end of that. Maybe it was the Yanks that worried him, I don't know. They did I suppose get a bad name with girls. So I think maybe that was it, he had heard rumours I suppose, yeah. I think that was it. So during the war years I was at home as a young teenager Raising money for the Army There were dances organised during the war years to raise money to send supplies for the army - socks and things like that.

We were keen on dancing so my older sister and I used to go and my father would let us go - but we always had to ask or get someone ask for us. He would know as well as we did that there was a dance on; he would have the local newspaper, the Impartial Reporter. He would be sitting reading it and would know that we were going to ask but you wouldn't know by him. So somebody had to ask, perhaps a boyfriend could ask, that was ok. Rationing Rationing was introduced and there were lots of things you could not buy unless you had coupons. We always killed a pig at home but it came to a point where you had to declare everything you had and you were only allowed to kill so much. Sugar and most things were rationed. We had extra butter at first because we were making it from the milk but then we had to send everything to the creamery.",938,190,1008,1097,False

There was never enough sugar in our house so two of us, my older sister and I, decided because we could only get it now and again that we would go off sugar in our tea so we did; and we stayed off it. My sister worked in a shop owned by our brother. Butter was sliced out in pieces of two ounces for each person weekly. Also sugar, tea, bacon in similar small amounts. People could get a small tin of fruit monthly, but there were no bananas. Clothes were all rationed and shoes and other things had to be got with coupons and there were no nylons unless you were friendly with the Yanks.

Carrots had to be sown as they were supposed to be good for airmen’s eyesight but all the main crops including potatoes were grown for supplying to the army camps. Getting goods across the border Being so close to the border this part of the country was very different to other areas and I think that in order to get by people might have done a bit of smuggling. Maybe across the border they would have plenty of one type of thing and we might have something different, so there was an exchange. Often we used to go across the border to get different things. At the start, before I was married, I didn’t live as close to the border as I am now so we cycled to Swanlinbar or sometimes to Blacklion, County Cavan. There were checks on the border but we had a way of escaping them. I can remember different times and we nearly always got word some way.",950,180,1010,1097,False

If there was a car coming out from the Republic and there was somebody on the look out they would flash their lights and then you would be careful. I can remember on one occasion coming out from Blacklion, I was with a sister-in-law and my father. Whatever he told us to do we would do without question. I had a wide coat on and he give me a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of something else, I forget what. But we were coming out and before we knew the police were in front of us. I dropped down the bottles onto the grass, just walked into the grass and dropped them. When I went back they were still there - by good luck, because they might not have been; it was the edge of the road there could have been stones, but we were just lucky.

They were about for a quite a while and after the war they went off. It was a big change in the area having evacuees. If there was a house, and there were only two people living in it, particularly if it was a big house, then there was no question of not taking them. In most cases they settled in well but if there were some people that had no children and just didn't understand them. So sometimes they went back to Belfast again or maybe were moved to another house. One thing that does stand out in my mind was when I was going to Church. This was before I was married and we were in the choir, there were five of us - three girls and two boys. There was this man, although of course at that time he was only a boy.

War was declared on the 3rd September 1939 and I recall listening to the radio when Neville Chamberlain the PM told us that we were at war with Germany. At the age of twelve the significance of such a momentous event was not appreciated, however to many adults who had lived though the first World War it was a disaster. One must remember that it was only twenty years since the end of that war. During the first years of the war “the phoney war” life continued much as normal, other than having to cope with the blackout, petrol rationing and a few other shortages. During this period one followed the course of the war though reading newspapers and listening to the radio. Nothing much happened in France.

Thirlmere was a quiet avenue and I got to know most of the residents mainly due to my weekly door to door sale of savings stamps. From what I recollect the stamps cost one shilling each. I was also a member of the Boys Brigade and the local youth guild. The guild was a great centre to meet other boys and girls. From 1937 I attended school at Belfast Royal Academy on the Cliftonville road. I took part in most sports however, rugby and cricket were paramount. I cannot recall that during the war years the playing of games was restricted I still travelled to other schools mainly on Saturdays to fulfil fixtures.

Whether ‘Bella’ had any affect on the defence of Belfast during the Blitz is doubtful. It was however responsible for damaging the stone gable to the school when the connecting wire was caught by the wind. I can recall the two Blitz’s in the spring of 1941. The first destroyed a large area of the city centre and areas in north and east Belfast. At the time we had no air raid shelter in the house so we sheltered under the stairs as we were told it was the safest place. The noise of the bombs exploding and the anti-aircraft gun fire from the batteries at the end of Sunningdale Park was horrendous. The sky across the city was lit up in a red glow by the furious fires started by the many incendiary bombs.

In the morning I cycled to school “What a sight” at the top of Duncairn Gardens the road was covered in thick mud thrown up by a landmine which had exploded demolishing many houses in the area. I remember the parachute from the landmine hanging from the tram wires. Many people were killed in the area including those sheltering in an air raid shelter at Cliftonville circus. On reaching school I think there were only about eighty pupils in attendance. The only damage to the school luckily was broken windows.

Apart from the social life already mentioned my friends and I would take our bicycles up to the Belfast Castle grounds where we made a race track and spent many happy hours in these lovely surroundings. On many occasions we would be able to see war ships coming and going from the Belfast harbour including aircraft carriers. We also enjoyed the lovely sight of the Sunderland flying boats landing on the Lough or taking off from the aircraft factory Short Brothers after their construction. I have a very vivid memory of V.E. day in Belfast. School closed early so I and a few friends made for the city centre.

My inexperience quickly revealed itself as I had not the slightest idea what type of drink to ask for. I can assure you this problem has not arisen since.

My mother did housework for a lady who for years I thought was very grand. I realised when I got older that she was living just a few streets away and just one of us. But she had a very pretty daughter who was a dancer and this girl worked in a nightclub in the centre of Belfast which was very popular with the Americans. This girl was only about 16 and was chaperoned everywhere by her mother and soon they both were making friends with the Americans and they would invite them to their home.

This lady's house was like an Aladdin's cave for me. She was very generous to my mother and to me. I remember how upset they were when the Americans moved out. The daughter had one special friend and she was planning to marry him when she was old enough. I often wonder whether this ever happened. The arrival of the Americans in Belfast caused a lot of bad feeling amongst the men. The Americans were so glamourous compared to the locals who had suffered four years of shortages. Girls who fraternised with the Americans were considered very fast and not 'nice' girls. I know my mother agonised a lot when she was given all the good things, whether she should accept them. I, however, had no hesitation and I think that that carried the day.

option1_combined all.docx,combined,protestant,"North Coast with my friend Barton McKee for a week's Youth Hostelling, which came and went too soon. Cycling back towards Belfast, we rounded the Blagh-hole on the coast road, and were completely astounded by the sight of our Belfast Lough, totally crammed with ships. There were heavily camouflaged naval escorts and a big number of cargo ships, presumably all carrying equipment and armour for the invasion, and all so tightly packed in, that it looked to us as if you could have walked straight across them and into Bangor without getting your shoes wet. We later learned that ships from all over the UK were collected in various locations for sending on to Normandy when the time came. Later that week, I woke to the news that the invasion had started and saw that Belfast Lough had quietly emptied of ships in the night. © Copyright of content contributed to this Archive rests with the author.

The first was on the night of 7–8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on Easter Tuesday , 15 April 1941, when 200 Luftwaffe bombers attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast.

[ 3 ] Background As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the factories and shipyards of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the Luftwaffe .

[ 4 ] Government The Government of Northern Ireland lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. James Craig, Lord Craigavon , had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. Richard Dawson Bates was the Home Affairs Minister. Sir Basil Brooke , the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister.

[ 5 ] John Clarke MacDermott , the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the ""Hiram Plan"" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible. [ 6 ] It was MacDermott who sent a telegram to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations: John Edmond Warnock , the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, ""I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction"" and ""the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.""

Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by J. M. Andrews , then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old Sir Basil Brooke on 1 May.

4 Scheme of Assessment 
4.1 Assessment opportunities 
For the availability of examinations and assessment, see Section 2. There will be one examination series each year, in Summer. 
This is a unitised specification; candidates must complete at least 40 percent of the overall assessment requirements at the end of the course, in the examination series in which they request a final subject grade. This is the terminal rule. 
Candidates may resit individual assessment units once before cash-in. The better of the two results will count towards their final GCSE grade unless a unit is required to meet the 40 percent terminal rule.",992,160,15,25,False

If it is, the more recent mark will count (whether or not it is the better result). Results for individual assessment units remain available 
to count towards a GCSE qualification until we withdraw the specification. 
4.2 Assessment objectives 
There are four assessment objectives for this specification. Candidates must: 
AO1 demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key features and characteristics of the period studied; 
AO2 explain and analyse historical events and periods studied using second-order historical concepts including continuity, change, cause, consequence, significance, similarity and difference; 
AO3 analyse, evaluate and use sources (contemporary to the period) to make substantiated judgements, in the context of historical events studied; and AO4 analyse, evaluate and make substantiated judgements about interpretations (including how and why interpretations may dif",1000,141,16,25,False

4.4 Quality of written communication 
In GCSE History, candidates must demonstrate their quality of written communication. They need to: 
- ensure that text is legible and that spelling, punctuation and grammar are accurate so that meaning is clear; 
- select and use a form and style of writing that suit their purpose and complex subject matter; and 
- organise information clearly and coherently, using specialist vocabulary where appropriate. 
Quality of written communication is assessed in responses to questions that require extended writing.

4.5 Reporting and grading 
We report the results of individual assessment units on a uniform mark scale that reflects the assessment weighting of each unit. We determine the grades awarded by aggregating the uniform marks that candidates obtain in individual assessment units. 
We award GCSE qualifications on a grade scale from A* to G, with A* being the highest. The nine grades available are as follows: 
If candidates fail to attain a grade G or above, we report their result as unclassified (U).

7.3 Equality and inclusion 
We have considered the requirements of equality legislation in developing this specification and designed it to be as free as possible from ethnic, gender, religious, political and other forms of bias. 
GCSE qualifications often require the assessment of a broad range of competences. This is because they are general qualifications that prepare students for a wide range of occupations and higher level courses.",865,125,21,25,False
GCSE History (2017)-specification-Standard.docx,policy,unknown,"neral qualifications that prepare students for a wide range of occupations and higher level courses. 
During the development process, an external equality panel reviewed the specification to identify any potential barriers to equality and inclusion. Where appropriate, we have considered measures to support access and mitigate barriers. 
We can make reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities to reduce barriers to accessing assessments. For this reason, very few students will have a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

So, do you mind- do I need to mention the school or?

00:00:17
P
Yeah, yes, go for it. Yeah.
P
No problem. So I've been teaching since 20- 2009, and I've taught so far in secondary, integrated and grammar. So I’ve taught in all three types of schools.

00:00:42
P
No problem. So yeah, secondary, secondary edu-, secondary, integrated and grammar. So I was 10 years in integrated. I had teaching practise in secondary and I've been in grammar school for five, five years now.

00:00:59
P
So 1000 in the current school and about 1100, maybe in the- the previous school.

00:01:11
P
Community background, so it's- it's a mostly, em, probably a Protestant area. But it would be kind of, it's a kind of middle-class area mostly, but with some- with some working-class areas as well I suppose so. So em be mixed probably about maybe about 75% Protestant, the remainder being Catholic or others.",890,159,0,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"o. So em be mixed probably about maybe about 75% Protestant, the remainder being Catholic or others.

00:01:48
P
Yep, so socioeconomic status, probably it's got- it's quite a- it's quite an affluent area around, quite a lot of the school, em so very middle class areas, but it does have other areas as well within the hinterland, which is actually be the more socially deprived, so it's good, good mixture of students, which is actually quite, I like teaching a good mixture of students to be honest, I'd much prefer that rather than have, em, more of one or the other. I like a good mixture in all respects actually, makes for better education.

00:02:28
P
Eh, the school's got a very good reputation so, eh, they would say it has a beautiful setting. It's on the shores of [Location]. It's got lots of like, lovely green space around it for kind of quite a built up area. Eh they’d say it has very high standards. They'd say the pupils are actually very well behaved. Very.",975,177,1,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"h they’d say it has very high standards. They'd say the pupils are actually very well behaved. Very. I would have to have high confidence that the pupils would be very respectful, very polite, in most cases. Em, and they would do the school a good credit. The teachers also very, very good bunch of teachers. Eh, very collegiate, work well together. Em, and the school’s got a very good reputation around Northern Ireland. It's the fourth oldest school in [location], so it's older than the older than the Albert Clock in Belfast [interviewer laughs]. So yeah, so it's got a good reputation. It's got good history. Em, and it's got a good, very good academic reputation as well. It is- it's it's doing very well.

00:03:36
P
So I'm a head of history and politics, but I teach, I've taught lots of other topics as well, other subjects, some through choice, some, some not so much [laughs]. But I love history, I love politics. It's ingrained in me.",947,169,2,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"choice, some, some not so much [laughs]. But I love history, I love politics. It's ingrained in me. It's part of the social fabric of Northern Ireland, but I absolutely love how history and politics kind of connects to the wider world, not just locally but nationally, internationally, I love the way it explains how the world works. I love seeing the- I love seeing the connections that pupils make in their, you can actually see it in their eyes sometimes or in their faces that they make connections between why something happens. So why the 12th of July happens, or why some people in the community might not like the 12th of July marches, or why em, Black Lives Matter and why that there has connections to the past and the present.
Eh why slavery has deep connections to, em, to the past, and how it's part of, you know, Britain's legacy, both positive and negative.",872,157,3,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"s to, em, to the past, and how it's part of, you know, Britain's legacy, both positive and negative. And I- what I love is I do have the privilege of being able to introduce like topics that I can actually teach within the school and I- I tend to make the topics very, very connected to contemporary issues and the pupils, once they get that, they realise that history's really relevant, and politics the same, you realise that politics can change the world. A lot of them don't realise until they come to study it that it really can and where their laws come- you know where they come from, how they can make a change. How as young people, they can make a change. So again, it's- I love the revolutionary nature of this the way they can actually, you know make a change themselves, and I've I've I've tried to make that happen. Em, and it's been quite successful in bringing lots of pupils into politics. Lots of councillors at the minute, which is really good and MLAs as well.",979,183,4,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"s of pupils into politics. Lots of councillors at the minute, which is really good and MLAs as well. So it's, [
P
So that's- that's a really good question. So, em, for politics, it's A-Level and A-Level is very much stipulated what you have to teach. You have to teach the politics of Northern Ireland. You have to teach the politics of the United Kingdom. Em, you then have a choice in- you got a choice within that, there of teaching judiciary or political pressure groups. So you, the teacher, can make that choice. Sometimes I make the choice of judiciary just purely because of a lot of pupils want to do law. At A2, you can make a choice between the Republic of Ireland or United States and compare both with Britain. I tend to do United States because it's actually a lot of pupils, unfortunately, with Trump coming in, it's it's very controversial, but for politics teachers in a way, it is fortunate because he does create a huge amount of interest in what happens in America. So.",989,181,5,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"ay, it is fortunate because he does create a huge amount of interest in what happens in America. So. So yeah, it's it's really good to be able to explain the whole political system in America. And then I choose political power for the last one, which I love connecting to current affairs and current events. Em, in history it's very different. So in history, because we have key stage three, key stage four and up to key stage 5. For key stage three, I love the way it's actually open to us what we teach. They only stipulate one thing that we have to teach now is partition of Ireland, how Ireland was partitioned. And you do that in year 10. And again, I think that's a hugely important part, anyway, so I would never leave that out [
P
Yeah.
P
Yeah, yeah, that the problem with history is history is divisive.",812,154,6,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"d never leave that out [
P
Yeah.
P
Yeah, yeah, that the problem with history is history is divisive. And people can look at history in a binary way, are you black or white or, you know, they they can take very very strong views on history and some people are are taught history through the prism of, you know a family or societal background. They're taught history from the walls outside their home or are from a very, perhaps prejudiced way you know, em, or from a community where it might be a security in their history, but you still have to, like, teach facts and you have to challenge prejudice and you have to make people look at the facts.  And opinion is fine as long as it's based in facts. So. So I I really do think that we have to teach certain subjects in order to actually challenge what people believe because, em, like what we believe is- is important to us, but it has to be based on, it has to be based on the right thing, you know. So I think it's really important that way.",993,193,7,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"ased on, it has to be based on the right thing, you know. So I think it's really important that way. Can you repeat the question? Sorry. [laughs]

00:11:24
P
Yeah, there would be ones that aren’t divisive, I suppose, in terms of divisive, I got- I’ll give you an example of this.  So, so slavery, [
P
I think they’re divisive because some people have security in their history. So some people believe that their history is the real history, and if you challenge that viewpoint then that can kind of challenge their identity in some ways. So they've kind of can can feel threatened by that. So. So I think my job is to to not necessarily threaten, em, their identity, but just to challenge it just to say, well look, these are the facts and bring that across and be able to sometimes be able to switch it over.",809,152,8,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"look, these are the facts and bring that across and be able to sometimes be able to switch it over. So a lot of times I would try to like put them empathetically and another, a different viewpoint [
P
Eh so, at at the school I’m at at the minute they're not divisive because they do- that- I think most people are very open minded. Em, and, and there might be some things that might be uncomfortable, but they can see how it's been, how it's been taught, and they can see the the different nuances of it. I think previously I would have taught in a different school. They would have had a very, very, very wide spectrum. It’s an integrated school.  It's got a very wide spectrum of opinion.  And at those very wide sides of that spectrum, you would get opposition, you would get much more strength of thought [
P
Yeah so we use lots of different things. So we we we love, em, I I'm quite digitally aware. I love lots of, eh, technology so, eh, so and I get the pupils into that.",978,190,9,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"I'm quite digitally aware. I love lots of, eh, technology so, eh, so and I get the pupils into that. So trying to engage with where they're coming from so.
So sometimes we hot seats, which is like, you know you give them like a role of somebody in society. So like it might be you could give them the role of Ian Paisley or a working-class Catholic in the 1960s or a loyalist in the Ulster Workers Council strike. Em, and you know the rest of the class can absolutely ask them questions which they do get in. Some of them are not very comfortable, but you usually tend to pick people, em, who are quite comfortable answering questions, and sometimes you sometimes you have to challenge all the class, to be honest, if you give them a role and they research it, they they're generally quite good at actually coming up with that empathetic ideas. I would also give them, eh, an iPad and some of them would be really good at creating videos.",938,176,10,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"ideas. I would also give them, eh, an iPad and some of them would be really good at creating videos. So so I teach them how to like do iMovies and they can actually go and maybe work out the reasons for the Northern Ireland Civil Rights movement emerging. Or, em, the reasons- hunger strikes, for example, if you actually give them a topic about, you know, like the hunger strikes, they they tend to actually look at it and research it, get into it and then present it back to the class. And sometimes that allows them to do it in a much more factually aware way. Eh, and they get really into it and they really are very good at presenting that. Podcasting's another thing that I use so, so we do lots of podcasting. We have things on Spotify, em, which we use.",761,146,11,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"other thing that I use so, so we do lots of podcasting. We have things on Spotify, em, which we use. Em, and then the class can, they're about to do this actually this week with Russian Revolution, so not necessarily a controversial topic, but, but we're going to do it with politics as well, where we can perhaps have a nationalist angles and unionist angles. They present different political parties. So some of them presenting, for example, Sinn Fein might be quite difficult for someone in the class who is quite Unionist or, eh, there’s people in the class who would be very nationalist, they really do not like, who’d be talking about the DUP, but they present really good posters on this and, em, presentations on this and they they get really into it and they can have a, you know, good, good teamwork as well is quite good in this.",840,153,12,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"get really into it and they can have a, you know, good, good teamwork as well is quite good in this. You usually get people working together here, maybe sometimes in different backgrounds, but they're working on one political issue or eh, or party or whatever it might be. So yeah, tends to be, teamwork and things that are really good to get them involved. Presentation's really good to get them involved. Em, and yeah, they can recreate different events as well. So big, for Key Stage 3 for example, there's a big, big chest, like almost like a treasure chest in my room and it's full of like, eh, wigs and hats and swords, well wooden swords, and um, lots of dressing up materials so they can actually then assume the the identity of different people [
P
It's just interesting seeing, you know, small school in [location] getting across the world, so it's good.

00:25:49
P
Ehh, that's a good question. A little bit. How do you put this? We call it adaptive learning now so.",977,178,13,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"Ehh, that's a good question. A little bit. How do you put this? We call it adaptive learning now so. So, that's a really good question. Yeah, they do differ. They do differ. Em, I think. I think in the school I’m in now, I can be a lot more, I can produce a lot more information to them. They would absorb a lot more information and they'd be able to take information from various different groupings a lot better and, em and different viewpoints. While you'd have to handle that information a little bit more carefully in the integrated background. Not not some- there's there's more debate in it, I think it's a richer debate in integrated sector, but I think the grammar school they eat into a lot more work and a lot more research.
Eh, not all, but most of the students. There's a lot of there's a lot of like students in the integrated sector that would eat into that as well.",881,166,14,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"s a lot of there's a lot of like students in the integrated sector that would eat into that as well. But, em, I think you have to provide a lot more material to the to the grammar school students because they like, they like eating that up [
P
Yeah, yeah, it’s definitely interesting. It’s interesting how you- you just have to be more careful of your, definitely visual images, I think more than anything else. And your balance, you have to be very, very careful of balance. So if you have a Unionist viewpoint, I always try to like then bring it on nationalist viewpoint to balance things out. Em, the GCSE course, for example, if you- if you taught GCSE, you have a choice at GCSE and it almost is, some people regard it as being a religious based choice. You have a choice between teaching Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland from partition to the 1960s, or from Northern Ireland from 1960s to 1998.",912,169,15,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"nd the Republic of Ireland from partition to the 1960s, or from Northern Ireland from 1960s to 1998. And some people suggest that the Unionists would do the first one and nationalists would do the the other one, but- Nationalist schools would do the other one.  But I don’t- I don’t necessarily see this as the case, to be honest, but.  Em, the, so the Northern Ireland course running from 1965 through to 1998. Em, it could be seen as having kind of a, because of the content on it, could be actually seen as having quite a nationalist tinge on it because, and that's just the nature of things because, you know, it starts off with like civil rights and you know, how the Roman Catholic Community they’d be like second class citizens with the Northern Ireland. And the reactions to that and how that's treated by the British Government and the Unionist government. So an awful lot of it would have, you know, some would regard as having quite a nationalist tinge.",964,174,16,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,". So an awful lot of it would have, you know, some would regard as having quite a nationalist tinge.
But you have to just be very careful how that's produced, em, and put through. So you usually have like different viewpoints the whole way through just to balance things out. But yeah, you have to teach it the way it is. [
small laugh]
And that's just the narrative that you're going through is very much, you know, about a community that that is, you know, fighting for its civil rights and the Troubles and how that's dealt with. So. So, yeah, it's it is as the nature of that is very controversial I think.

00:29:19
P
Yeah, I've taught it in both schools, so integrated school and in school I'm in presently I would teach that. Em, so yeah, but I like teaching it, I think it’s- I think it's really good. It's the Troubles. So you know again it's it's very, it's not very far removed from the generation that's here. It helps them to explain their parents and their grandparents.",984,184,17,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"oved from the generation that's here. It helps them to explain their parents and their grandparents. Like em, and it helps to explain the Good Friday Agreement and what's what we're dealing with now. Thankfully, really good, because since I've been teaching it, you can see a whole swathe of new opinion. So like you don't have pupils who have that pre-loaded mindset of unionist or nationalist. They think of it of a real open mind.
I love that. [
P
So yeah, a lot of them engage really well. They've got a real interest in it. They, they can get the injustice when there is injustice. They can understand the reaction, they can understand the... they can understand the steps that have been taken, sometimes in response, but you can tell of everything, it's almost like what's quite interesting now is like the Troubles is not necessarily, umm, very well known to a lot of them. So.",884,158,18,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"interesting now is like the Troubles is not necessarily, umm, very well known to a lot of them. So. So it's almost like each thing that they're teaching each unit that you're teaching or each section you're teaching at that unit is opening up a new story, almost like a chapter for them. [
P
Yeah, so there's one thing that's quite controversial that's relatively new. So whenever you're teaching 9/11, for example, you have to teach about the rise of the Taliban. You have to teach about Islamic fundamentalism, but you have to be very aware within your class now. So it used to be, used to be thinking of a Protestant/Catholic all the time. Now you have to be very aware of, em, you have to be very aware of, you know, people within your class who are from a-I’ve got Syrian pupils, pupils who have Syrian background, Iraqi background, em, Somali background, and for them you know, you have to be really careful of the words you use. You know, if you're talking about Islamic fundamentalism.",993,179,19,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"to be really careful of the words you use. You know, if you're talking about Islamic fundamentalism. Well for them some of those might be, you know, some of the key concepts within Islam. They might like, you know, view this as attack on, on religion. You have to be very careful of how you you actually view that.
Eh the Iraqi war, you have to be very careful with, you know, you don't want to put a Western style stance in this at all. So you have to be very careful again, showing both sides, Afghanistan, 9/11, you again, you have to teach this in a- in a way that really engages, really challenges but you have to really careful of how you present that.
And I’ve talked with other teachers because these are things that sometimes we don't- Yeah, so I've had other teachers phone me, to ask about this, ‘how do you teach this?’.",832,157,20,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"es we don't- Yeah, so I've had other teachers phone me, to ask about this, ‘how do you teach this?’. I've- I've had this issue and I said well, actually, you know what, I've actually had this issue as well as we have to maybe adapt our teaching methods every year to try to be very careful of that as well too. [
P
No, I think that's usually good. We usually like try to do individual, teamwork and then whole class. So. So yeah, I think we try to just build and- and use lots of different techniques to engage. You happy enough with that?

00:34:07
P
Yeah, I think so.

00:34:12
P
Yeah. Again, it might be. It may be something that'd be areas of that we mentioned before, but for some elements of the Troubles can be difficult if you have like a a wide range of opinions in a classroom. So for some it might be really difficult and sometimes you find, like, people in the class that have real connections to the Troubles.",922,178,21,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"ficult and sometimes you find, like, people in the class that have real connections to the Troubles. So I've had people in the class, for example, who have had grandfathers, grandmothers killed in the Troubles, shot in the Troubles, blown up. Em, I've had people in the class as well too, who have had political murders against them as well. Bloody Friday, have had some connections to Bloody Friday, so there's civilians who got killed in that.
Em, so we have to be very, very careful of some of these, these connections. Em, oh, sorry, what was the question again?

00:35:20
P
The most- most difficult is... The most difficult is probably breaking down maybe, dealing with pupils who maybe have just a very, very, very ingrained viewpoint and they do not want to be moved. They just like, they're just safe in where they are and they do not want to be moved and perhaps to be honest, their family doesn't want that challenge as well.",935,167,22,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"do not want to be moved and perhaps to be honest, their family doesn't want that challenge as well. You don't get it very often, but but there are some who just, they just want to believe what they have been told to believe and probably what their parents have been told to believe as well too. So sometimes you just get very, very challenging to try to, you know, get them to look at things in a different way. So you can, you can go so far with- but you know some sometimes. You, you're not able to break that down, but you you do try, you continue to try. Em, and then sometimes you get quite extreme views.
Em, so like I would have got to see quite a lot of the Andrew Tate type of like real, real chauvinist, more than that, the misogynistic views, you got to see that coming through an awful lot at a certain point. Em and you find that disgusting, absolutely disgusting, seeing this come through. Em, and yeah, it's the only thing is I would say that is like that.",971,189,23,45,False

I do find that challenging, I find that really upsetting, I find it makes me really angry, but it's also something as well, I think it's our duty to challenge and to be honest, we're the best to challenge that and we do challenge it any anytime we've, we've found that.
And we have, you know, I’ve got to see this in both schools I've been at, like where we we've actively set out to, em, isolate, break down and eradicate that sort of feeling, certainly within our school community.
Em, even even the teaching the Suffragettes, for example, you would have some, that would come through some- one time anyway. You could actually see that coming through with the boys’ views of how women were treated in the 19th century and you could certainly see that coming through. And you realise this is just wrong.",905,166,24,45,False
TeacherP_reconciled.docx,interview,both,"he 19th century and you could certainly see that coming through. And you realise this is just wrong. To be honest, it's quite good, you can end up with a class debate though and the class debate you tend to have like you know that’s well crushed towards the end of it, and yeah, it, it leads to like a very strong, I think what I like as well too is seeing the female perspective because there some of the the female students would be really, really smart. But they're also very, very quiet sometimes and then you see them stand up, take a stance challenge. And eh yeah, and be able to outwit some of these people who are putting forward these views. And to be honest, that's far better than me doing it sometimes, and I let them do that. I can see this is actually makes them make a stance. I love that. I love seeing them do that. So. So yeah, you do find some racism as well too.",882,173,25,45,False

There's more diversity now so, em, now luckily I haven't got to see very much of this here, maybe a little bit more in the past but but I do still think it's a massive challenge in society. And so in all the classes I’m trying to bring in lots and lots of things to show. I gave them, I’ve got pupils from the Philippines. Em, but I'm able to bring, you know, British Empire, but also the Spanish Empire, and then able to say where the Philippines comes from, even the name. And then it just it kind of brings the whole even what they eat, to be honest, it sort of shows we live in a real global community. So it helps the whole class gel well and see their place and identity within our school, within society as well. Hope that’s okay [small laugh].

We're silver award and we’re heading for gold this year actually. So. So pupils are- I love actually really have been really struck by how much the pupils engage with this because it is quite a- like the UNCRCs, at the start they weren't really getting that. But we do a right of the month competition. Em, there is lots of prizes every month and they have to try to remember what the right is and try to be able to explain it. We then connect this in every topic so we have, em, say for example, oh, so we have like a link to Uganda. We're building a school in Uganda in May time, I think. So an awful lot of the school are going over to Uganda to help build a school there. [

That's that's a really good question, so. So I try to build up all my own sources, but I think I think even if having the social media background, I've got links with Queen’s, I've got links of other schools.",989,195,27,45,False

So it leads to lots of different links. So for me I've got lots of links with other schools and that really helps us to get different sources of information, different viewpoints as well. And I've had lots of really, really good people come in to speak to the classes. So I've had, for example, ex-prisoners. I've had politicians from all spectrums.

Yes, yes, yeah. Has to be relevant and topical because, you know, if we continue sticking to the old topics that are outdated, they're not going to connect, so again things like internet, ‘should mobile phones be used in schools’ is a big one at the minute, huge, because a lot of schools are going down the line of totally banning them, which only really works probably if parents 100% agree.

Do you know, even with- with the textbook. The textbook unfortunately can be out of date within a couple of weeks, and a child can go on Google and whether it's right or wrong and they can believe what we've got, I've got a different statistic. So, em, actually, eh say the teacher was wrong.

But because I think more people are watching videos and YouTube where it's shorter, em, and quicker their- their concentration spans are shorter. So now the exams are
usually an hour and 15, an hour and 45.  45 and 45, would that be an hour and 15?

And now hour and half for a lot of them, even an hour. I've I've sat and I've covered exams where they've got an hour for an exam and they do it in 20 minutes.

Now again, that could have happened when I was at school too. You know, there would have been students that would have done really quickly or given up. So it's. But I think more are tending to go, ‘No, I can't. I'm not thinking anymore about it. I've done it.",951,190,21,37,False

So the police are the best people to deal with that because obviously, we can't really as teachers, do anything about that and it is a legal topic so. Say the police, community police come in maybe once a year and- and talk to, or if there's an incident, then the school probably contact the police and say ‘in a particular year group there's been issues, can you come in and talk to them about…?’ And there's little videos now I've been made that can be play",1000,184,26,37,False

Em, and you kind of then have to give them like ‘What if, what if’ scenarios and ‘how would you feel if that was you?’ Or ‘what would you do in that situation?’ to get them to think critically. Because I said, remember I told you about the boy who was like, ‘Oh no, immigrants are coming here and they're taking over the jobs’. But whenever he did this, his own research and I was like, ‘oh, how would you feel if that happened to you and your family and all of a sudden you were at, you were told, right you have to go home and grab your bag?

I always like to take the approach that we need to, even if you are a Unionist, which I myself am, we need to have an open mind to the fact that, just because we're Unionist doesn’t mean that every Nationalist argument is wrong. And I found the plantation of Ulster, it actually confronts a lot of the pupils with the reality that the Irish were living their lives and the planters came over.

I think we need to appreciate that actually our way of thinking isn't always correct. The openness to hearing opposing points of view and also confronting the fact that you're wrong on something.

Q
It's hard to, perhaps sometimes, separate yourself from your personal feelings on things. Like Northern Ireland is, it is contentious. But, in a sense as well, one of the problems is that you're dealing with a mostly unionist audience, and therefore your temptation would be let's present this in a Unionist supporting way. When you get to topics like [clap] Bloody Sunday where you know that the parents and grandparents are probably very pro, you know, British Army, it was a fault more so on the nationalist side, the temptation is to not get yourself into the contentious side of it and present the other point of view to the same extent.",830,152,17,39,False

That's something which has been ongoing. The bombing that’s taking place now, you know that, and, you know, there's events that I know from my family's history that they went against the grain, you know.

Now, obviously times have changed, and people do change, but again, it is hard to look at events when you know you have family involved in it.
